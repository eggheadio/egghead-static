    "transcript": "<p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Hi, Hiro.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Hey.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Thanks for taking the time out of your day to come talk to me. I'm really excited. I'm excited to talk to you about breaking gates open. That's something that I know we're both passionate about. But first I just want to ask you another thing that we're both passionate about and that's cooking food. You are on the Internet and you share recipes and you show cooking. And I was wondering, do you have a best dish? Do you have a signature dish or something that you love to cook the most? Out of anything that you prepare?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               So something that I love to cook, because it's so simple and you can make so much at once because it's just a big batch meal, is Japanese curry. So I like to just add whatever I have in the fridge at the moment. But it's also a great way to clean up your fridge, right? You can use any vegetable, you can use any stock you have leftover. And it kind of feeds a dozen people, or you can use it as a meal prep. So yeah, that's something-</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Is it one of those dishes that changes every time? Like you have a base, you come at it, and you know what you're going to cook. But then it really depends on what you have on hand at any given time.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, I mean usually it's like start with potatoes, onions, carrots, and those are the staples. But everything else it's kind of whatever I happened to have in the fridge. And there might be broccoli in there one day, or some really weird vegetable. And they're like, \"What is this?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, don't worry about it. It's just stock of some vegetable that I was like, \"Oh, this looks like it can be eaten.\"\" So-</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               One of my favorite cookbooks right now, it's an incredibly upsetting book about sandwiches. And one of the things he does in this book is he puts broccoli, he likes to put broccoli, inside of like a breakfast sandwich. So it's like a bacon, broccoli, cheese sandwich. It's amazing. Roasted broccoli in a sandwich. Like, and I was ... that was my reaction to. I was like, \"Ooohh.\" In practice it's really, really delicious. So whenever we're roasting broccoli, we always make extra so we can throw it in there. And just that ... I love the idea of a core dish, but you can make it different every time. So you'll never get sick of Japanese curry, because every time you make it, there's going to be ... you're putting a little twist on it. The downside is when you land on a really good one and you're like, \"Oh, I wish I wish I had that-\"</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               You don't know how that happened.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. It's like, \"All right.\" I'd like to know a little bit about your background. And I know we're both, we're in technology, we're around computers, we're a part of this flood of folks pushing information and data across the Internet. And how did you get here? What's your story, and how did you get to where you're at in terms of being a technologist?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, so my background is in special education. So I have a bachelor's, a master's, in special education. And my kind of life goal was to become a teacher and teach kids. And when I started college, I decided that I wanted to become a special ed teacher. And obviously it's very different from what I do now. And I kind of had a career pivot before my career even really started, because I had brain surgery when I was in college. And it was kind of apparent after a while that the strenuous workloads of being a teacher might not be the best thing to do at the moment.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               So I moved to New York looking for something else to do. I wanted to work in a nonprofit and disability advocacy. But I quickly found out that, one, they're not hiring. Or two, they want you to work for very little monies. And it didn't really work out. So after half a year, I actually got a job as a help desk engineer. And they were fine with me having no background in tech. I was like, \"What the heck is an Outlook? I've never opened it before.\" And they're like, \"You're going to fix it. You're going to fix all those issues that people have with Outlook.\" And I'm like-</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah, it's fine. Follow the script.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               \"It's Outlook.\" Yeah. There was no script either, was just the problem. But I became very good at googling. So they hired me, and that was kind of when I started my career in tech because that was something that was not anything I ever thought I would do. Because tech was this big black hole of like, oh, scary techie thingies. I couldn't possibly be an engineer. I couldn't possibly be working in tech because that's not what I do. I'm a teacher. So from there I started working in tech, and my last job I had was as a sysadmin at a tech startup in New York. And I recently quit that job to focus full time on teaching technology. So I've kind of made a full circle after five years.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               I asked you ... I kind of accused you beforehand of being a web developer. And you told me that you're not a web developer. But still I want to talk about that because I feel like maybe you are. And it isn't something you set out to be, but is web development part of what you do at this point?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, a little bit. Web development for me is a tool to get what I want out into the world. And I started coding, and the Vanilla HTML, CSS, and all that fun stuff, back in middle school in the early 2000s, because I want to make Internet friends to talk about anime. As we want to do, as a middle schooler who don't have friends. So then that kind of escalated from making fan sites and blogs and coding up a storm learning everything from lissaexplainsitall.com, and just looking at how other people created websites. And back then it was very simple ... I mean it was very simple in terms of like, oh, something new came out, divs came out, tables came out. And then you just kind of start incorporating those things into your code. And when you see someone do something new that you and your friends haven't done yet, you just go and investigate the source and be like, \"Oh wow, this is cool.\"</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               And then you kind of figure out how to make it happen in your own website. So I was coding from middle school through high school, and at that point, when I started college as a special ed major, I kind of gave all of it up because it was a hobby and something to do for fun. And I didn't realize at that point that web development was an actual job, like something you can get paid to do. Because I guess it's something that you would have known if, I guess, if you have people around you who did stuff like that for a living.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               But where no one around me had done that as a job, no one had parents who do that as a job, so I just figured it's just a hobby that I need to give up so I can focus on my college. And lo and behold, we're still using HTML. And I was actually really baffled when I learned two, three, years ago at my last company that the web still runs on HTML and CSS and JavaScript. And I had assumed that the world had moved on and-</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               No. We're a long ways away from moving on those three pillars. I think they're going to be here for a little while yet too.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, I had no idea. I thought the world had moved on to something very different. So I couldn't possibly catch up, you know? And that was when I started kind of dabbling back into code and learning HTML 5.0 And CSS 3.0 and Bootstrap and stuff like that. And kind of spending a few months doing that really helped me be able to push things out when I want to without having to wait for someone else to create it for me. So web development, to me, is a tool. But yeah, I've never really thought of myself as a web developer. But maybe-</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like an identity for you, right?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Like it's a-</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               It's a skill that I am very happy to have. Basically.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               I think it's funny, because you talk about in middle school and high school, you're doing anime, and you're doing it because you love it. And you're watching what other people do and what your friends make something cool and you want to do that. And I honestly feel, like for me, that's how it works now, right? I've been a professional, and I've been doing this for a decade or more now, and I feel like that the entire time, that's what it is. It's like paying attention, seeing what people you like and respect are doing, your friends are doing, and then trying it yourself and learning more. And whether they're our direct friends or not, it's just like people out there that are doing stuff and building stuff and open source and all this kind of teaching that everybody's doing all the time is really ... that's the joy of this kind of technology in general to me, is that thing, that thing that we're all doing together, and kind of growing and helping each other.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. And I also love that unlike a lot of other hobbies that might cost a lot of money if you wanted to do what Joe over there is doing, it's like we find something that's exciting, and you just open your code and be like, \"Oh, let's try it out.\" You know? And you can just do it right there. So I think that's really exciting.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               I've seen it described as like an infinite game. There's finite and infinite games, where the finite game has an end and there's a winner, and then there's the infinite game where we're going to be playing this forever and we can do this for as long as [inaudible 00:09:46]. And we're going to be able to keep doing this and stacking on, there's no winner. We're all just playing a game, and we're competing against kind of the past and seeing what we can build, and the possibilities are endless. It's very exciting. I think it's a cool time to be a nerd. That's my philosophy. So you made a big transition. Because you were an employee, a W2 employee, you had a steady paycheck, and you decided to stop doing that. And you've gone kind of independent, and left that world, and become a freelancer, a consultant. How do you describe what it is, and that transition?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah. So in June I left my full time job as a sysadmin at the startup that I was working at. And it was kind of like, \"Do I do it or do I not do it?\" And the answer was I'm going to do it at some point. But I was realizing that at some point you just have to kind of make a decision to do it. The right time, quote unquote, is never going to just show up.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               It's hard.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               And yeah, it's always like, \"Oh well, but you know, those stable paychecks, the benefits, the retirement.\" There's so many things that come with a W2 full time job with benefits that it's really hard to give up. So I had my birthday, my 30th birthday, in June. And I turned 30, and it's kind of like a big year. It's oh you going from your, quote unquote, young adult to the 30s, where you're supposed to be an actual adult.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Good luck.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Thank you. Thank you. It's not working out, but whatever. So when I was thinking about the fact that now I'm 30 years old, and I have ten years until I'm 40 years old. And I was asking myself when I am turning 40 in ten years would I have been proud of myself for staying for an extra half a year at a job that I really don't enjoy and was turning really toxic for sake of ... I think it was something like $3,000 of a 401k match. Because it would've made me three years in, and it would have vested 100%. And I was like, \"Hmm, probably not.\"</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               It's like, you can accomplish so much in half a year. But I was using that as an excuse and as a clutch, my 401k vesting, to push it off for half a year. And I was like, \"You know what? No, I'm just going to do it now.\" And I'd always kind of saved and invested for just the few years that I was working. I was only working in corporate for four and a half years, enough for me to be able to be comfortable with potentially not making any income for a while. So I made that leap, and it's kind of been fish out of water situation again. But I think because I don't even know how to pay taxes anymore. Apparently you have to pay it four times a year.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               That's a real struggle. Like I know that. On the paperwork side of that, now you're responsible. You talk about all the other, like the benefits and all that, but also people are taking care of all the paperwork.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, \"Oh, so everyone wants me to set up an LLC so they can throw me jobs and contract gigs. How do I set up an LLC?\" And you think it's like beep, boop, couple buttons, there you go. Pay a couple hundred dollars, it's done. It's not.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               No.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               And there were so many things that I was like, \"Okay, this is the end product that I want, like an LLC or 401k or something.\" But then it's like, \"Okay, how do I get there?\" And it was kind of like starting career in tech all over again, because I just couldn't figure it out. And it's so hard to find resources that kind of teach you from zero to someone who has absolutely no idea what they're trying to do.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. So my favorite resource, I don't know if you've seen this, and just to throw this out there for anybody that's listening, Stripe. I love Stripe and I talk about it all the time. They changed my life and my business. But they have Stripe Atlas. And have you seen Stripe Atlas?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, they don't do LLCs anymore though.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Did they quit?</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. Even then though, their documentation ... in terms of ... their documentation is probably the most consolidated information on that whole process of getting started and handling all the ... just the stuff. Like how do you do ... if you want to consider like a freelancer, like a startup of one, right? How do you feel [inaudible 00:14:14] that. And that didn't exist when I started a company either, and [inaudible 00:00:14:19]. And I'm always ... and I and I will put that stuff off until they're knocking at my door to impound my TV or whatever. It's just hard. It's hard to even get the energy to do it. At the end of the day. You're doing all this other stuff and trying to figure out how to make a living. And then on top of that you have to be comply with regulations and all that stuff.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, I ended up using a place called Northwest and they did file my LLC for me. But now I'm trying to look for an accountant. And I'm just like, \"Oh my God, this is like finding a doctor, that perfect fit doctor.\" It's so overwhelming and you have no idea how good of a doctor that person is until you go in.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               No. And there's bad accountants too. It goes-</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, yeah. Exactly.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               There's bad lawyers, there's bad accountants, and there's great ones too. And how do you find them?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, how do you find them? Yeah, so that's been my couple of months of like uuhh. It's like every step is like trudging through mud.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               So what kind of work are you doing now? What are you doing as a freelancer? What kind of gigs are you getting?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, so my main gig, I guess, that I've been doing for a little over half a year now, is technical instructors. So I'm a LinkedIn Learning Instructor and I teach Introduction to AWS to non-engineers. And I have four courses out with them right now. So that was my big thing that allowed me to kind of take this step and quit my full time job. And I that's kind of like done-ish, or it's a video course. So you create it, you put it out into the world, and you kind of update it periodically. So as like an active consulting I do ... I write technical articles. I'm a technical writer, so I write blogs, I write articles, and I have my own stuff that I write, obviously for kicks, that I don't get paid because I don't pay myself.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               But I also get paid to write technical blog posts by other small business owners. So that's kind of been my main thing. And I'm looking to kind of expand to maybe giving seminars on the same kind of topics, maybe in person or webinars and stuff like that. Kind of just expand a little bit of my repertoire. And now that I'm getting a lot more comfortable kind of speaking and recording, I think that'll be a bigger part of my identity. But for now I'm writing mostly.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah, it's weird when you start doing that. And you record these courses. And for me anyway, there was stage fright. And it's like you're putting yourself out there, and you're talking to a microphone in the comfort of a studio or your home, but there's that feeling, that feeling of butterflies, and just kind of stage right. That goes away with practice to some extent. But yeah, it's an interesting phenomenon. What do you wish that you had've known before you ... you've been doing this ... you're, what, pushing six months now, almost? Five months of being in this. What do you wish you had have known before you even started that you could have learned ... that you hadn't learned, and that you know now?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Oh God, there's so much that I wish someone could have just been like, \"Hey, so here are these things that you should know.\" Which would probably be how to do accounting, how to find an accountant, which I haven't figured out yet. But for accounting and stuff, I use QuickBooks. But and how to set up an LLC. And kind of also how to network kind of. You have to set your rates, you have to go and talk to potential clients and what not, but I have no idea how to do that. And mostly I've been ... the stuff that I've created kind of has spin talking for themselves, and I get people reaching out to me based on the stuff that I have out. But I know I should be taking a more active role in finding potential partners to work with. But even now, I'm not really sure how that works.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. And there's so many different ways, right? Like there's so many different ways you can approach this, and there's a lot of different advice out there. And just like finding professional services, some of it's good, some of it's bad. It's really hard to just sift through it. You said something to me that I wanted to just kind of ... I'm going to read a quote, actually. \"It's my job to open the gates and let people in. Teaching is the absolute fundamentals and basics so people can speak the language that others are speaking, and have conversations.\" And you were talking about the idea of how do you even break in, and how do we open tech, in this kind of amazing world, I think, that we get to work in and live in. How do we open that to more people? And I was wondering, what does that mean and what are you trying to do in terms of teaching and giving people that basic vocabulary?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah. So this is something I'm really passionate about, because I was also a transplant into tech with zero background. So kind of like everything that I learned, I had to kind of learn from zero and googling and watching YouTube videos and things like that. And what I found a lot was a lot of documentations, a lot of resources, and a lot of even video courses, they kind of take for granted that you speak this certain technical jargon vocabulary. And they don't take the time to explain these fundamental phrases or words that kind of make it or break it. When you don't know those specific words, it's like you're missing huge chunks of vocabulary that's in the book. You can't understand what's going on, even if you understand every other word in there, because those are just so important.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               And one of the things that I experienced a lot, I don't know if it's gate keeping ... what is gate keeping? But when I would go into interviews, they would sometimes just throw acronyms and words and phrases at me, asking me to define it. And I'm like, \"Okay, I don't know what these words mean because I know how to do things, but I don't necessarily know what these words mean, or what the acronyms are.\" And I'm like, \"It's not really relevant to me being able to do these certain tasks that you would want me to do as a part of this job. But instead of focusing on what I can do or how quickly I learn, you're focusing on whether I know what an acronym stands for.\"</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               And it's also very difficult to talk to other engineers. Or even if you're not a technical person, you're not in a technical role, like you're in marketing or something, and you want to talk about AWS because that's what your engineers are using to upload your website. And you're in marketing so you have to know how the websites are doing. If you don't know what an EC2 is, S3 is, AWS is, you can't even talk to them. But it's very hard to find resources that are written for people with no engineering background. And like AWS technical documentation is notorious for being ineligible.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Oh, I've spent time with it. I agree with that. And AWS and, I think, is a particular standout in that case. Because it's immensely powerful, but also immensely complex. And dense. And you hit it nearly ... it's like hitting a wall of confusion. And vocabulary ... we're literally learning new languages, right? Like if you talk about JavaScript and it's referred to as a language. Or HTML is a markup language, right? Like we're talking about languages.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               And if you don't speak that language, it's like being dropped in a foreign country with no context and no ability to communicate with locals. And you just kind of have to stand there and wave your hands around or whatever and point at things and hope you get it right. And languages is the absolute critical step, right? The vocabulary is the first step. It has to be. And you don't ever see ... do you see ... I don't see glossaries. I never see glossaries do almost anything. Like we're just defining the primary terms. That's something that should maybe change, I think. In terms of education.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, yeah. A word that we love in cloud computing is scaling. And what does scaling mean?</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. It could mean all sorts of things.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               It means so many things. It's such a convenient word, because you can use it for anything. But people don't take the time to define it. So how is someone who doesn't have a technical background, who kind of understands the concept of scaling, how are they supposed to understand what you're talking about if said you're scaling this, this is scalable, scalable, blah, blah, blah. And what I try to do in my courses, and the writing that I do, is kind of deconstruct those jargons and define it and explain it, so that people can understand it. I don't want to take for granted the easy way out, because those easy way outs are what causes a lot of the gate keeping when you're just going in a loop trying to define something. And the definition of that word is that word. And you never find out what it exactly means.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               And I think it's important ... because you said, \"What is gate keeping?\" And I don't think it's necessarily people ... and maybe there is some kind of like evil doers out there that are intentionally doing it, but these are things that we're just ... it's just like par for the course, right? We're not like, \"Oh no, you don't know those words.\" It's just we're speaking this way and then whether it's intentionally or unintentionally using acronyms, using initialisms, speaking in jargon, and it has that effect, right? It's not necessarily that we're intentionally doing this thing, it's that we're not intentionally doing the opposite, right? We're not intentionally opening the gates and making it more accessible to folks as they come in.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah. And it's intimidating. And it's not a surprise that people kind of get scared out of joining. When they open a website trying to learn about something and they don't recognize half the words on there.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. I've rarely read a book where I didn't understand it and blamed to the book. I blame myself. And whether it's the book ... it might be the book's fault, it might be my fault. It's the lack of context. There's all sorts of things going on. But I rarely am like, \"Oh, this book is why I couldn't learn this topic.\" It's always like, \"Oh, I'm just not smart enough to learn this.\" That's not really ... it's just more about context and vocabulary and understanding. Maybe you have to go back a layer. And that's what it sounds like you're trying to do. And your course is called AWS Newbies. And you said it's really built not for developers. How do you explain AWS, and maybe even the cloud, to people that aren't developers?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, so the cloud, I literally explain it as, hey, it's the Internets.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               It's true.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               It's everything. Everything's running on it. Twitter, Facebook, website that you go on and you spend ten hours of your day on, chances are it's on the cloud. It's not the scary behemoth of a thing that we can't understand, but cloud computing just means there are really big servers running in data centers. And you don't have to worry about them anymore. So I kind of just try to bring it back to what they might already know, but also link it in a way that's like, \"Oh hey, all these names make it sound like it's something really scary, but it's not.\"</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               I think they tried to make it sound fluffy to me, right? Like, oh it's the cloud, it's cool. Don't worry about it. It's up 99.6% of the time. Everything will be okay.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Everything's fine. Until it's not. And Google Calendar goes down.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               It's essentially somebody else's computer that you don't have to worry about.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Exactly. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Until you-</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Serverless.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               ... do you have to worry about it. Yeah, exactly. There's no servers. There are a lot of servers.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               There's no servers, it's just a cloud.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               So what do you do? How do you stay productive? And I share an ebb and flow. My productivity goes up and down. And sometimes I can be really productive, and sometimes I just can't, my body doesn't let me. And I'm wondering, how do you deal with that? And especially now that you kind of have to set your own schedule and motivate yourself, what's your go to in terms of getting things done, I suppose?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah. So that's actually a huge problem for me because I have a pretty severe executive functioning problem. Which executive functioning disorder came from my brain injury from my brain surgery back in the days. And so I kind of have to create a structure for myself. And once I'm off running, I can be neck deep and doing something for hours and hours and hours. But if I can't get that switch turned on, it just doesn't happen at all. So the on and off is just extreme for me. And I just try to kind of create a situation where the only thing I can focus on is that. I get very easily distracted. So I might throw my phone across the room. I might take my laptop to a cafe somewhere, just where I can't do anything except that certain topic.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               And it's kind of ironic, because before I quit my job, I was spending 40 plus hours a week doing that full time job. And then almost every evening and every weekend and every holiday, I was doing my side hustle jobs. It was just constantly going on and on and on and on and on and just never stopped. And when I don't stop, it's fine. I keep on going. But I also have stress induced rheumatoid arthritis. That's a very bad way for me to live. So now that I quit my job, you'd think, \"Oh, I have 50 plus hours a week that I've gotten back,\" but I am not any more productive than I was when I had a full time job.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Well, there is no free time, right?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               No there isn't. Somehow it's taken up by something. God knows what. So my mind is just kind of like set a to do list, break down tasks into small, manageable chunks. Because I get overwhelmed pretty quickly. And just kind of going one by one and checking them off.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Do you use any software or do you have a favorite to do list application?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               So I've gone through a lot-</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. Me too.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               ... but now I kind of stick with my bullet journal. And because I like this physical sensation of checking something off.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               No it's great. [crosstalk 00:29:07].</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               That's very rewarding to me. And stickers. Anything that tricks me into doing stuff. Right?</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Are you a crafty bullet journaler? Where you go all out, or are you kind of a ... I'm pretty stark in mine.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               No. I try, but then I can't keep it up. So I just go very simple now.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Oh yeah. It makes it ... well then it ends up like your bullet journal is now a job. Because you can get on-</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, it's a chore.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               You can get on Pinterest. Right? And you can look at bullet journals and it's like wow, you people have a lot of time.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               I know.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               And it's just amazing. And I can't even ever live up to that. Mine's just like I do like the basic, the way you originally explained bullet journaling towards the beginning.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just to my daily to do, weekly, monthly. Just so that ... I'm very afraid of forgetting something, because I have a very bad memory, so I just have to ... if I write everything down, then it kind of tames my anxiety because I'm like, \"Okay. It's now out here. It's not in my brain anymore.\"</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               It's such a simple system. Because part of the whole cycle is the review process, where you'd go back and you'd look and, oh, I didn't do that. Is that still important? No. Cross it out. Oh yeah. Yeah, it is important. I'm going to move that to a future date or into my current list. It's a way to keep sane. There's so much stuff going on, and how do I manage any of it? And I think we lose, we've been talking like this a lot at work in Egghead, and like we lose so much information, right? We have conversations, we have meetings, we have things we want to do, things we want to accomplish, and it's like a sieve and it just like goes away. And trying to capture that and trying to build on top of what we've already done and stop losing so much information has been a real challenge. I think that's just getting worse because of the flow of information that we're kind of having to deal with.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah. And there's just so much. All day, every day.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. It's constant, which is amazing, but also frightening, and often anxiety-inducing, to be honest. So you're a reader. I love to read books to gain knowledge. And I've had so many books that have changed my life. And I was wondering what really stands out to you as essential reading for somebody that wants to kind of make it in this information age in the modern times of the Internet?</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               So a book that really impacted me in the past maybe year or so, was the book Called How to be Everything. And so the title is How to be Everything. And the subtitle is A Guide for Those Who Still Don't Know What They Want to be When They Grow Up. So it's kind of saying how a lot of people ... when adults talk to kids, they ask them, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" And you're only supposed to have one answer, right? You're supposed to be this one thing. But that's because-</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Web developer, right.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, one thing.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Whatever you-</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Oh, I'm going to be a librarian. I'm going to be a firefighter. I'm going to be a scientist. But then there are people like me who have a lot of interests, a lot of things that we dabble in, and we start to think, well, maybe we're supposed to be focusing on one thing. Because you can't hone your craft, right, if you're so all over the place. And I am definitely one of those all over the place person. And I ended up being able to kind of consolidate a lot of it into what I do now, which wouldn't have been possible if I weren't all over the place in the first place.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               But this book kind of just tells you, \"Hey, that's okay. You don't have to have that one big thing in your life.\" And it kind of introduced you to multiple different ways of having a lot of interests. Some people have like one core interest, but then couple of smaller ones. Some people split their days evenly between four. They're all main passions. They have to have all of it in their lives. And then some people are like Phoenix's. They go super deep into something for a couple years, become like industry top, and then they're like, \"Okay, moving on. And just start somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               So there's all these different ways of having a lot of interests. And I saw a lot of my past couple of decades in that. So it's kind of like revelation that, oh, hey, I'm not broken. I'm not mediocre in the ways of oh, I'll never make anything out of myself because I'm not interested in just one thing. So that kind of gave me, I guess, it's weird to say permission, but permission to kind of keep on doing what I'm doing. And half a year later here I am. Have created something that didn't exist before.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               No, I love that. I love that entire philosophy. And I think there's merit in deep specialization, and we need that in the world. People that they go as deep as possible because there's so much that comes out of that. But then at the same time I think there's so much to just being out there and exploring interests and going deep and coming back up and going deep and learning across the board. I get bored, and that allows me ... because I approach it in a very similar way, where I can do different things on a daily basis. I can decide different things. And sometimes I feel really good about writing, or sometimes I feel really good about doing design. Or whatever it is, but we're able to move between those. And it's nice and I'm going to check that book out. I hadn't heard of it before, so thank you.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's just kind of I brought my interest in teaching, I brought my interest in accommodations and modifications with kids with disabilities, which allows me kind of to come from a very creative way of explaining things. Because the whole five, six years I was in college, I was learning how to approach things in creative ways so that the student can learn. And that plus tech plus AWS just happened to kind of show up and somehow all those very different interests got looped together into teaching AWS to non-engineers.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Yeah. It's a powerful combo. I think ... I look at that experience that you have and I think it's a really good combo for ... and important. And something that I think you'll be able to succeed at going forward. I have no doubts. I want to thank you so much for taking the time out to speak with me today. It was really wonderful to get to know you a little better. Thanks.</p><p><strong>Hiro:</strong>               Thank you so much for inviting me.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong>               Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>",

    "transcript": "<p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Hi, Khalal.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Hey. How's it going?</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Going great. How are you doing?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      I'm doing pretty well. Can't complain too much.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, I'm really interested in talking to you about learning to code and some of your opinions on bootcamps and how they're structured. But first, I want to ask you. What happens when I texted dad to (202) 410-4710?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right, right. So, what will happen is you'll get added to my dad jokes subscription list. And what'll happen is you'll get a dad joke around 9:00 p.m., Pacific time. I mean it'll range from 9:00 all the way up to 9:06, should be. And sometimes, if it's slow, maybe 9:10. But you'll get a random dad joke every day until you opt out of that service.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, how does that work? One, I want to know, how do you come up with that idea at all? Because it's fun. I love that. I just signed up and I'm looking forward to my first one. But how do you come up with that idea? And then, how do you go about building it?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Cool. So, first and foremost, I was really interested in this company called Twilio. They actually work two floors below the building that I work in now. I always see them and I met some cool people. They're like, \"Yeah, we build... We have a SMS-like API that's centered all around communication.\" So, I was looking through their API docs and I wanted to learn how to build something, how to receive and send text messages.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      At that same time, I was also looking to learn how to code in Python. I'm pretty good in JavaScript, so I just wanted to see if I could just build something out in Python. So, I think... I don't remember exactly how I came up with the idea, but I did find the free dad jokes API. It's called icanhazdadjoke.com and when you go to icanhazdadjoke.com, it'll give you a random dad joke.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      So, I was like, okay, we have free API. I was like, how can I get people to get these cool dad jokes? So, how it started was I didn't have a subscription list. The only thing that would happen is, you text dad to the phone number and the phone number would send you back a dad joke. I posted that on Reddit in the Python subreddit.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      And I think I got maybe 2,000 upvotes.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Oh, nice.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      And my Twilio bill went crazy. I went through $50 in the first day that it was up on Reddit. I was like, well, this isn't sustainable. So, I don't think I could burn through $50 a day, just so people can get dad jokes from this free API to their SMS. So, I was like, instead of that, I made it into like a subscription service.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      So, I looked into MongoDB. I didn't know much about MongoDB. I'm semi-familiar with NoSQL databases. So, went about how to hook that up. So, instead of texting... When you text dad, you'll get a joke. You text dad and you'll be added to the subscription list. And then, in the event you text stop, you can always be removed, because people don't want to keep receiving messages for things that they've unsubscribed for.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Right, right.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      So, yeah, that's how that came about. I think it was just more so just wanting to learn, one, how to do things I already knew how to do on JavaScript with Python 2, learning how to use the API. I wasn't really familiar with 3. I wasn't too familiar with... Oh, yeah, right. I wasn't too familiar with server-side programming.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      I've done the majority of my work in Angular and React, and I just wanted to see how to set up a quick server with flask with two end points. And that's how you get it done. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I've played with the Twilio API and, honestly, it's probably one of the best APIs out there. It's so friendly and their documentation is good. What was your experience like using Twilio?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right. I mean, Twilio, they have a good amount of documents to get you started. And then, they also have a great documentation on if you want to just build a project. So, they have content creators, probably, in the DevRel realm pool make content on their website to like, \"Hey, if you want to build something like this, this is how you could do it,\" and it'll help you step by step. So, I think their documentation's great to have support and code snippets for many different languages.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      So, if you're not JavaScript, if you're Python, if you're Ruby. I think they even have Java documentation. They have many different languages you can choose from that'll help you get up and running. And then, in the event that your language isn't there. If you're just familiar with programming, it's... Some things may be different, but you can Google and maneuver to make that code work for whatever language you're working at.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. And I feel like they really... They cover the most popular ones anyway, right? You're probably going to be covered. But even if you aren't, you can just use straight HTTP calls and use the API, and it should be clear.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         And how was Python when you got into that? It was my first language, actually, after just hacking around and PHP and stuff. The first language I really learned was Python and I love it. And I'm wondering, how was it for you?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      That's cool, yeah. Python is like... It's really cool. I like it. A lot of things are more... I don't want to say straightforward, but I'd say it's more... It's easier to read, just as far as just reading code. It's like a more human readable, legible, not sure which word, but-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, I agree with that.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah, I think it's just easier to read. My first language was in school and it was Java. Yeah, it was Java in school. I didn't like coding in school, because all we did was algorithm and data structure stuff. And I didn't really get a chance to go outside of my curriculum, because I was on scholarship. So, my only goal was to keep my scholarship and to keep my GPA at a certain point. So, I'm like, if work is anything like this, doing stacks and trees and heaps and... I don't want anything to do with this. So, yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I wonder sometimes, because this is a theory of mine. And school is fine and computer science is great. And people learn however they're going to do it, but I wonder how many people have been completely turned away from this, this kind of amazing career where you get to build cool things like dad jokes in text messages simply because the classes are built like that and structured around data structures, and algorithms, and Java, and all that kind of... Like, that section of this field.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah, tons. I mean, I'm pretty sure it's a lot of people. And I think the... I will say I think the biggest thing for college is, I guess, you'll be pretty prepared to interview, if that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      You'll be pretty prepared to interview, because that element is still there and a lot of these technical interviews, they're... It's still there, but all of the people who I've talked to who started tech jobs are like, \"Yeah, we didn't learn anything about using stuff, just using APIs.\" And I felt the same way. I'm like, don't know how to build things with version control, in a collaborative effort. Just stuff like that, that people use every single day and that just doesn't get taught in a curriculum.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         And I feel like the job interview process feels like it's almost a direct extension of that tradition, right? Like, the college tradition where you're learning this specific thing. So, that's what we're going to test you on, because we expect you to have learned that and we want to make sure you learned it well, or whatever.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, yeah, with the-</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      I mean, majority of the time, these technical interviews, you'll do these find this node and this tree. And you'll never see anything like that again on the job. I think that maybe we should... Those interviews should be structured or how the job is going to be-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Like, real work, right?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah, right. I'm not saying get rid of coding interviews all together, but just something that's transferrable. I'm not going to go... If I'm a NBA general manager, I'm not going to go and scout my point guards that are six flat to how good they can post up against centers. And then, grade you on that and like, \"Oh, yeah, you're not good in the post, so you can be a terrible point guard.\"</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      So, yeah, it's just change how the hell that's done.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. I think about that a lot, because at 10 years in, if you asked me to solve FizzBuzz, which is kind of a classic programming problem, right? It's supposed to weed you out, to eliminate people that can't code at all. I couldn't do it without... I would look it up. I could probably sit there and do it, but not in a time where you'd actually hire me.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         And I'm a decade into being a professional developer, and I've built my own business around coding and teach it. I couldn't do it without time and the ability to do a little research. I suppose you could prepare for it but, still, it doesn't seem realistic to me along the way.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right. The creator of Rails had a tweet a couple of years ago. He's like, \"I can't do a binary search tree. I created this framework, this Ruby on Rails. Everyone used it. It was hot. It was the hottest thing on the market at one point. And people are still using it today. And I can't pass a technical interview. Does that mean I'm inadequate? No, it just means we need better ways to assess how we go about finding valid programmers.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. So, you use a a site called LeetCode. I've seen you talk about that and could you explain what LeetCode is and how you use that?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right. LeetCode is pretty much a website that has tons, probably hundreds, probably thousands, I'm not sure, of these programming questions that are more than likely going to pop up in technical interviews, especially if you're interviewing for the FANG companies or... And just a lot of companies still has this type of, I guess, the structure of the interview in that we talked about.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      So, there's tons of questions on there that'll help you practice, that'll... You'll see some of the same patterns that'll come up in multiple questions, which will help you recognize them later on. That'll pretty much help you get better for the interviews.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, FANG is Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, right?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right, right, right, right, right. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. So, is that addressing what we're talking about, or is it good practice and something that you would enjoy, otherwise?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      If I didn't have to do it, I wouldn't do it, if that makes sense. But, I mean, I, personally... As of right now, I don't see myself being a full-time entrepreneur and if I'm going to play this game, how it is right now, the game is the game. So, not happy with it, but-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Well, I mean, you can swim upstream or swim with the current, right? It's kind of a... You either get in there, or you fight and struggle, I would think.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Well, yeah, I mean, it's going to be a struggle. And I'm not saying you can't swim upstream. I just don't think, right now, is the fight that I'm-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         No, I'd say it's a personal choice, right? It's not... you know? I don't think it's bad either way, right? You go with the current... You get the gig, get the experience and progress your career is ultimately the goal.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, right now, what's your favorite stack to work with? What are you working with?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      For me, I really like React. At my day-to-day professional job, I use Angular. But I really do like React. It took me a while when I was first learning how to use these frameworks, how to understand what props and state were. But the more I did it, the more it makes sense. And then, with the introduction of hooks, it kind of made everything... I'm not going to say easier or simpler, well, maybe simpler.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Clicked?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah. It just clicked to me. When they talked about hooks, I was like, wow, okay, this makes sense, a lot. So, yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, using React and Angular, I think they do have similarities. And then, they have a lot of differences. And how do you compare them, when you compare the two in terms of how you'd use them or what kind of project you might pick one up over the other?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right. I'd say the... I mean, some of the similarities are the way data gets passed down. I think, like in React, we'd use props. And then, in Angular, you'd use an input decorator to pass that down. And then, some of the differences will maybe be how the frameworks, the two frameworks or library separate their concerns. Like, how Angular, for the most part, you'll have a component which has a HTML file, a CSS file and a TypeScript file.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Or you can put your templating inside of your TypeScript file, but it's still separate. It's not like React, how you have everything together in one function. Or it doesn't have to be one function, but in one JavaScript file function, however you want to call it. Yeah. So, they kind of merge those concerns and that's what some people prefer.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Some people like to have their concerns separated.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         What about TypeScript? I know Angular. If you're building Angular, you're probably using TypeScript, right?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right, right, right. Yeah. I mean, TypeScript's pretty cool. I mean, for, if you've come... Like I said, my first language was Java. So, TypeScript made a lot of sense to me. Just looking at a function, knowing what type of arguments are going to be called or passed in, what type of variable is going to be returned, if it's returned at all, if it's void, if it's a Boolean, if it's a number, et cetera.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      And then, being able to build interfaces for how data should look. So, if it doesn't match that, you get an error throw knowing that, Oh, this does it. This doesn't match-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I think that, for me, is like the killer feature actually, like interfaces. And there's a lot of... TypeScript is, there's a lot going on. But that's what I miss the most when I'm in just plain old JavaScript is this idea that we can create contracts and have interfaces.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right, yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, I want to get into learning to code, because I feel like a lot of people want to do that. There's so many opportunities out there. There's businesses to... I run a business where we teach people how to code. So, like bootcamps are kind of almost controversial, it feels like. It feels like there's some good ones. It feels like there are some bad ones.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         And I know you have opinions about bootcamps and I was wondering. Do you recommend them for people that are trying to break into this field?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah, I'd say, I don't recommend new coders jumping straight to a bootcamp. Because, well, I'd say the reason is why, you should probably get pretty comfortable learning on your own. Because from what I hear from a lot of bootcamps is there's going to be a lot of learning on your own, anyway. So, you should probably get comfortable learning the basics on your own. And there's a lot of resources out there that can be used.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      And so, I'd say, first, you just want to get the basic programming fundamentals. A lot of these bootcamps actually have you interviewed to get in, so they know that you're... At least, you have the basics in some boot camps. You submit an application and you write them a check, you're in. So, it's just that level of difference.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      I just think you should, at least, take some time to learn on your own to make sure this is what you want to do or what you want to invest in.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, I agree. Because, I mean, there's one and make sure you... It's something that you really enjoy and you want to dedicate, because regardless of your bootcamp experience, you have to put in the work. And that's true. That's true for college. That's true for anything, right? If you are not doing... If you're not going a little bit extra and you're just sitting there in class absorbing what they tell you. Good luck, at the end of the day.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      All right. Yeah, that's true.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         With bootcamps, to me, one of the big things, I think, would be vetting them, right? Like, doing the research. And have you seen anybody that's had success on doing that or how would you go about figuring out what bootcamp might be right for you?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Vetting. Yeah, I'd say, for me, one would be to try to find people who went to the bootcamp. Don't look on these websites that... Course Report, I think, is one where almost every bootcamp is five stars. And you just know that's not true. And, I think, if you go out and use Speak... I mean, everything can't be five stars or nothing's five stars. So, I mean, I think you should go out and like... I went on LinkedIn.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      I typed in software engineer and the name of the bootcamp and clicked people, and just scrolled. And I messaged people, every person that I saw. Some people got back to me. Some people didn't. Some people had good things today... to say, only good things to say. And then, some people gave it the real. So, I think just having direct contact with people who attended these bootcamps and that are willing to be honest with you to give you the good, the bad, the ugly.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      I think that's going to be, ultimately, the best review you can get is from personal. It's directly from people who went there.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, I think one thing to keep in mind is that there's a lot of venture capital. There's a lot of money, like billions of dollars in this industry, in the education side of this industry and the bootcamps. And so, they're funded and they get growth hacking, right? That's part of their business model.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         And then, you get ISAs, right? Where they're telling you, \"Oh, you don't have to pay anything. It's basically free. We just take a... 20% of your salary for five years,\" which-</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah. It's like they're really... So, all these bootcamps, they're really, really, really good at marketing. I mean, as they should be. Bootcamps are this new... kind of new. Well, they're still new compared to college. This a new hip thing, not too many accreditations for them. So, we have to get people to trust us. So, you know what, hey, no money upfront sounds like a dream. But we take X, Y, Z of the money you get when you start making X dollars.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      And, I think... How do I put it? One, there's a certain level of financial privilege to be had to be able to attend a bootcamp, Two, you're probably really, really better off than most people, if you can pay for the bootcamp upfront. Three, the majority of people who opt for the deferred payment typically aren't going to have 18 to 20 whatever thousand dollars up front to pay, which makes a lot of sense.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      So, hey, nothing upfront. Now, when I get a job, it'll be all good. And I think it sounds good upfront, because you want to land that first role. But the amount of money they can take on the backend, it hurts. You're looking at a $17,000 bootcamp, but they say, \"Oh no, don't pay us now. If you wait until later, we'll just take 20% for two years. You get a job for $120,000.\" I'm sure they max out their capital.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah, we can take up to 50. And now, you have an $18,000 bootcamp that just went up to 50,000 but just because you didn't pay any money upfront, you feel like it was a big win. So, I just think people should look at that from that standpoint, because that really hurts people who may not have as much money. And then, it's almost like going to school. And then, you graduating with a debt, but this debt is only after 13 to 16 weeks.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Your bootcamp's a lot shorter. So, now, you got $50,000 worth of debt in the 13-week period. And that's what people may get after a year or two of college, or three or four depending on where you go. '.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         In some cases, it's almost like a payday loan.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Right. Exactly like a payday loan.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I think, it's like people don't understand either that they take this debt, right? The ISAs, they take this and that's like a financial instrument. And it gets sold almost immediately to a third party, and they can garnish your wages and just basically hunt you down for... until they get their money back. And it's not the bootcamp or the institution that does that. It's whomever they sell it to and that can be passed around.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         It goes into whatever sort of fund that acquires those kind of things.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah, yeah. That's how the banking and... That's how the banking industry is. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. It's high finance, right?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Pretty much.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. So, that said, we got into it a little bit, but what are your favorite resources? How do you... If somebody wants to go out there and they either want to prep. They might be thinking about a bootcamp and they want to get ready, see if they really like this. How do you recommend that people do that work?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Cool. I'd say a platform that I swear by would be... It's this website called the Odin Project. Pretty much, it's an open-source curriculum that'll teach you how to code, but how to teach you how to get your development environment set up on your machine. So, you'll go through the struggles with configurations. You'll go through how to set up-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So hard.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Certain... Yeah, that's really tough. And when people learn how to code, they use a lot of platforms which, I guess, are good for beginners that only focus on the coding aspect. It's like, all right, now I actually want to build something. Oh, I didn't know I had to set up all of these things. Instead of coding in the browser, you're coding in your text editor of your choice on your machine. So, the Odin Project, it's a full stack web development.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      It covers Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS and then, JavaScript for the front-end. Then, they just recently added a node course. And then, they have some SQL stuff. And then, they also have some resume prep and interview prep. And I think this was... It was started by a person who either attended a boot amp or created a bootcamp. I'm not sure which one. I don't want to misspeak.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      But, basically, all of this is free and it's just reading tons of documentation, because that's what you're going to be doing. There's an entire community behind it. They have their own... What's the platform called? Discord chat to where you can reach out and ask questions in certain channels to talk to people. And it's a really big community.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, that's awesome. And I really think that, because I've watched people. I really like to like find people that have never really coded before and watch them try to get into it. And it's something as simple as loading your HTML file with JavaScript once you've got it in there. And how does that even work? And getting it in the browser and there's this whole fundamentals that you forget, right?</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         After a while, I feel like you forget the struggle that goes into that and the terminal and all the other stuff that goes along with it.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah, definitely.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. So, I think a lot of this like breaks down into habits and being able to work. And it feels like, I call it... It's like a... I had to hustle, right? I work two jobs and I learned how to code at night. And I'm wondering, what sort of habits have you developed or you think are important if you want to break into this field, and do it and kind of in a sustainable way?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      I think you have to just... I'd say, one, you just can't... You literally just can't give up or quit. And that sounds like the most cliche thing ever. But it's literally so important, because you're going to hit walls. You're going to struggle. I think, the biggest thing with being a developer is just banging your head against your keyboard for eight hours of the day. And the last hour, you just see the light and you just keep finding different ways until something works.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      So, I take that with learning how to code. In the beginning, you're going to mess up on syntax. You're going to forget a semi-colon. You're going to miss a quote. And some of these things may really, really bother you. But if you keep at it, these things will become second nature. And then, you'll have new struggles.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Because when you have new successes, you move on to new problems. And so, as long as you know that in this industry, it's always... Things are going to get easier, but you're always going to be learning something new. You're always going to be learning. You're always going to be growing and you just have to have the willingness to take on that challenge every single day.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      And I think that's probably the biggest thing.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I think, yeah, it's like a fundamental stubbornness. That's the mindset. And if you have to be just tenacious, because almost all of these problems can be solved. And it's so frustrating though. But when you solve it, I don't know that there's a better endorphin rush than when you figure it out and get to tell the computer what's up.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah. That's like one of the biggest. The days I don't, I'm not productive. I feel down. I'm like, oh my goodness, am I even a developer? Then, the days I'm killing it, I'm like, man, come here. Like, who? I can code anything.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. I've stood up out of my chair and just told the computer exactly who the boss was, until the next day when the computer showed me.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Exactly. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I don't know if you have any sort of fundamental books that you've read or source material and not necessarily related to computers, but have you... Is there anything essential that you think people have to read and know, in terms of getting a really good career in software?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Does it have to be a programming book?</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         No. It'd be great if it wasn't, to me.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Well, the book I probably would... What changed my attitude or mind on everything on life would be the Subtle Art of Not Giving a F. And that book really taught me... The title just sounds like, oh, you should just walk around and not care about the world. It more so talks about where you should place your cares and your values, and how that'll make you a better person. Let's say, someone places their cares, or values, on how many likes they get on a photo.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Now, when you post a photo, you literally can't control who's going to like it or not. You can control how much you promote it. You can control how many people see it, but you can't control how many people like it, right? So, the book tells you just to place your values on things that you can control, on things that... Yeah, that you have control over.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Because if you place your happiness and your values on things that are in someone else's hands, then someone else will always have control over you. And I think with that, even in programming, I'm still learning this now. When you go out and you start interviewing, you're going to meet these, I don't know, gatekeeper-type people who are going to make you feel less than a programmer. Less than this, less than that.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      But I just know that things I can control is to make sure that I'm a better programmer today than I was yesterday and just to be able to see the progress, that I'm better than yesterday or I'm better than a week ago. I'm better than a month ago. And I think it's really hard to see, because we always take time to compare all of these other notable developers and we want to be that. But they weren't always that, right?</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      And you can't get there until you get better tomorrow than you were today.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         And it's like you said. You have control over not quitting and doing the work, and studying, and learning, and growing as a person. That's something that you control and you can make the decision tomorrow to do that. You can't make the decision tomorrow to have a job at Google. That's not in your control, but you can work, right?</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         You can do LeetCode, or you can do whatever it takes and do the work towards that goal. And that's something that you can control. One of my favorite-</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      That's true.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         One of my favorite books... I love that book, by the way. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is excellent. And it's funny how many books after that book have the word fuck in the title.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yeah, because people were all afraid. They're like, you can't do-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Oh, wow, that's good marketing.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      They'll never put you in the front, in the front of Barnes & Noble as soon as you walk in, big orange book, hi.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         And the audio book is amazing, because he has a New York accent and there's a lot of cursing in the book. So, it just really... It really pops. But it's essentially a stoic philosophy book. And my favorite book in that... My favorite intro text in that area is A Guide to the Good Life. Which, really, it's like the same fundamental thing, right? It's focused on what you have control over.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Don't covet other people's... You can have people, and you can admire people and strive to be a better person and be more like people that you admire. But, really, you can only control what you can control. So, you have to work on that. And that's it. That method is great. And I think, that epiphany, if you can have that. It's hard. It's a daily work thing. You always got to work on it.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Yes.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Work on that.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      Control the controllables. If you can control something, do it. If you can't, you shouldn't be worried about it. You literally can't do nothing about it. And spending time worrying about something that you have no control over will only make your mental state worse.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. Yeah, I agree with that. Khalal, thank you so much for hanging out with me and chatting today. I really appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Khalal Walker:</strong>      No problem, man. No problem, man. I appreciate you.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Cheers.</p>",

    "transcript": "<p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Hi Tracy.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Hi.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Thanks for chatting with me today. I'm really super excited. You do a lot of things that are very interesting to me and I've been kind of watching your path over the years, and I want to get into that, and I want to talk about This Dot Labs, and I'm intrigued about your hiring and apprenticeship programs, but I wanted to start with the important thing. I want to talk about barbecue, and specifically I was wondering, what's your favorite way to barbecue meats?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          We use a Yoder Smoker, called the YS360. My husband is in tech as well, so he has rigged it up with all the things.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Is it Arduino-powered?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Well, it's not Arduino-powered, no. It's electric and it's a pellet smoker.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Oh, okay.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah, but the reason why we wanted it was because usually when you sit there and you cook a piece of meat, you have to keep checking it over and over and over again. So, if you're going to cook a brisket or pork butt, your day is completely shot, because you have to monitor the temp the entire time. You have to stake the fire and all these other things. But with the Yoder Smoker and a lot of these other things, first off, the pellets, they feed themselves, so you don't have to touch it at all. And then, the other thing is we bought this really cool thing, it's called a fire board. I don't know if you have that as well, but it monitors so we can leave the house, go shopping, do whatever we want, we're not attached to the barbecue.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, it's like the old Ronco Rotisserie Grill. You just set it and forget it.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Set it and forget it. Yep.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Nice.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I love brisket the most, brisket and pork would be my two favorites.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, with your brisket, do y'all go with the Texas Crutch? Are you familiar with the Texas Crutch?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I had to look up the Texas Crutch the first time you mentioned it, and we haven't done the Texas Crutch yet. So, the Texas crutch is when you wrap it in foil to make it cook faster?</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         It's like it gets to a certain temperature, and what they call the stall, where it just doesn't seem like it's climbing, so it's either paper or foil, but you wrap it to give it like a cooking boost, while still maintaining your bark, because if you lose your bark you might as well just go to Arby's.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah, that's actually kind of interesting, because my husband was cooking a pork butt the other day, and usually when he cooks a pork butt there's a little bit too much bark on it, like it's a little bit too hard. So-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         It's like overwhelming.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yes, but we ended up wrapping it, and it kind of toned it down a little bit and made the bark more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Oh, okay. I think I saw pictures of that, and that looks to me like kind of the same principle as what they call the Texas Crutch with a brisket, just kind of applied to a pork butt. Looked delicious, by the way.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          [inaudible 00:02:41].</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         You post those, your delightful barbecue meat pictures are amazing, and apparently there's a whole community around dead meats.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah. So, here's one question for you. When you do brisket, do you cut off the fat?</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I trim it. Not all of it, because you need a little of it. I've actually had a problem if I don't trim it enough to where it's a fire hazard, like a really direct grease fire hazard, which is quite the ordeal to have when you're just trying to have a nice barbecue. So, I do trim it a bit, but I don't trim it too much, because you want to have a little bit. People get so technical with it, do you cook it fat side down or fat side up? It's almost like frameworks, right? People feel very strongly about how barbecue should be done.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I get so mad if he even suggests to trim it, because I need all that fat. I don't care, [crosstalk 00:03:28]-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         It's delicious.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah, but a lot of people are like, \"Oh, but if you don't trim the fat, then the fat gets the flavor and the meat doesn't get flavor.\" I'm like, \"Okay, forget it. I need that fat.\"</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. Well, I mean it's the good part. It's like, I've been to Franklin in Austin, which is incredible. The brisket is not overrated. It's worth the wait at least once in your life, but they'll be like, \"Do you want lean end or fat end?\" It's like, \"Uh, yeah, fat end, please.\"</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Obviously the fat end. Yeah. I'll have to [inaudible 00:00:03:52].</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. I've heard you referred to as a serial entrepreneur. Is that something that you identify with, do you identify yourself as a serial entrepreneur to begin with?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yes. I'm always starting something. So, I don't know if you're familiar with like astrology signs, but I'm an Aries, and my Uber driver one day told me that what it meant to be an Aries means I'm a fire sign, but I'm a fire starter. So, that really fits with kind of everything I do, like every time I see something I'm like, \"Ooh, maybe we should start something.\" So, I've started quite a few businesses since I was 18, and some of them work, some of them don't. Most of them don't work, but I'm happy that This Dot Labs and my last company, Dish Crawl, worked out.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         What has worked? You mentioned Dish Crawl. Can you tell me about what that was? Give me kind of the elevator summary of that adventure?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          We were a tech startup, but we were more tech-enabled. We'd take people on food adventures. And so, we grew from 15 people to 250 people in one year.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Wow.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I was insane. Yeah, across the U.S. and Canada. So, that meant we were in 250 different cities. That was nice. And then, I sold that a few years ago, and then just really started focusing on This Dot, which has been my baby for the past few years.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Were you a developer when you started Dish Crawl?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I was not, actually. I mean, my parents are developers.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Okay.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah, I guess they are developers. Engineers, developers, whatever, you know. I wanted to go into business ever since I was younger, and when I started Dish Crawl... It's so hard, because even now I talk to people who are doing startup, or even people in large organizations, like, \"Is this the right tech choice?\" And they a lot of times ask me like, \"Well, you know, I heard about this thing with React Native, and this is why I think that this is good,\" or \"This is why I think Angular is good.\" I remember asking myself the same questions, like, \"Do I go with PHP or do I go with Python?\"</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, with Egghead, we were like, \"Is it Rails or is it Django?\" Neither of which really matters that... Like, six years in it does matter, but at the same time, do something.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Exactly. Yeah, and I remember it was so painful, like, I had two PHP developers as co-founders and things were just not moving. I'm like, \"Man, this takes so long.\" I met guy on Reddit, I used to be super big into Reddit, and he was just like, \"Eh, this isn't really what you want to build.\" And then he built me a website using Python, and just like, we threw away like a year of code, and then the business just kind of took off.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. So, it's funny, because I'm like, \"Oh, it doesn't matter, just do something,\" but at the same time, it really does matter. Your tech choices make a difference. I don't know, it's always this weight of, how much will this matter and what is the tech choice?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I feel like if you're not technical, it's almost like you're scared to make the decision. I've been there, because I used to not be technical, and it's like, \"Oh my god, we're doing Python. What does that mean? Okay, it seems like a good choice,\" but you have no idea. I find all these people I talk to these days going down these paths and I'm like, \"Ooh, should you really do that or should you not?\"</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Well, I imagine, like when you're sitting there and you don't have the technical background or vocabulary, people are literally speaking a foreign language.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Oh, it's so hard. It's so hard to make decisions based on things you don't understand.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, and you have trusted advisors, but at the same time, it's like your livelihood is hinged on these decisions.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I got into development because I had sold the company, and I was kind of in a transition period. I had to obviously start at the new company that bought us, and I was like, \"Okay, you know what? For the first time in many years I can actually shut everything down, like I can literally actually ignore everything for three weeks.\" I took an HTML, CSS, JavaScript class online, eight hours a day, and I highly recommend any business person to do that. Even two weeks.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I remember me and my co-founder, he used to come to me and be like, \"I could do it the right way, or I could do it where we're going to have to clean up some technical debt.\" What does me, as a business person who doesn't understand what actually technical debt means, do? I choose the one-day thing versus the three-day thing, and like, two weeks of just learning what code means.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Also, the other thing is, it really made me stop and think about meetings differently. Like, even as this business person, now I group together all my meetings, because I used to be like, \"Oh, co-founder, you're not in a meeting. Oh, he's probably bored. Oh, he's not involved.\" Like, my god, I was just killing his productivity the entire time.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         By having sporadic meetings throughout the day versus grouping them so that you have a head space to work.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Exactly. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. I think that's really interesting. I don't think I've ever heard anybody articulate that. We have these coding bootcamps. We have folks that have business. If you are in that industry and you can afford to do it, taking a sabbatical and applying that to a coding bootcamp could be a very powerful lever for your entire rest of your business career.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          It's a night and day, really. I mean, I think even as business people, you think like, \"Oh, I have an eight hour day, and I can just schedule meetings.\" Now, even if I'm not doing development, I'm like, \"My god, you can't get anything done if you don't have chunks of time.\" You don't have to be a developer to kind of maximize that, but I think until you're a developer, or at least until you're in places where you have to actually focus to do your job, you don't realize the actual value of it.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. I think business flow state is really weird and more difficult, where getting into a flow state as a developer makes more sense. It's almost hypnotic, like you start solving a problem and you look up and it's two in the morning, and you're like, \"Wow.\" I've done it with business. It just isn't, I don't think it's as natural of a occurrence.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, you did Dish Crawl, you exited that, you sold it, took some time for yourself. I remember, because I would see, you started popping up at literally like all the JavaScript conferences and the Angular conferences with Power Rangers costumes and taking fun pictures. Your selfie game is inspirational and very on-point. I love that approach. I can tell you're having fun, and I think that's amazing.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         And then, that led into what you're doing now, which is This Dot Labs and This Dot Media. How do you describe that to people? How do you describe what you're currently doing to people?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          This Dot Labs, specifically, is a consultancy where we really try to help enterprise companies and startups get to the next level of whatever they're doing. So, we started off as a bunch of experts in the industry. I'm on the [inaudible 00:10:27] core team, I'm a GDE, a Microsoft MVP, and all those other things, and so are some of my co-founders, and we just love the idea of helping people. So, sure, fine, we do consulting, but consulting itself isn't really that interesting to us. What's really interesting to us is this idea where we can kind of take a holistic approach to mentoring people, mentoring developers, helping make a difference within their organizations, helping transform how they think about what a developer should be, right?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Like a few weeks ago on Twitter, the 10x developer drama that was happening, oh my gosh, such a hot mess. But it's this idea where within your engineering organization, you shouldn't be a 10x developer. You should be really promoting the idea of a 10x mentor. So, helping everybody within an organization, within a development organization, should be helping facilitate each other to be successful. I love that, because technical problems are fun to solve and everything, but helping people succeed in a bigger way is way more interesting in my opinion.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, I mean, like lifting people up and helping everybody achieve. To me, the 10x developers, the person that can do that and spread what they know, not necessarily that they can write 10 times as much code or produce 10 times as many features, but they can help others, and when you spread that mentorship across them, that's when you get the true lift, and it lasts for a long, long time. It's like a longterm investment, nobody's getting burnt out, and more people are succeeding.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah, for sure. Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, you've scaled this business too, right? Dish Crawl blew up and you scaled that to to 250 cities, and you've grown from a small company of experts to now you've scaled this business too. I think that sort of thing is hard. Hiring and being an employer has been super challenging to me. So, I was curious, what do you wish you could tell yourself before you started this, all of this, what would you go back and what would be the advice you would give in terms of scaling a business and adding employees and people to your business to collaborate with?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Oh, lord. I mean, we just hired like seven people in the past month. So, if anything, life is a little bit insane right now.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, I imagine.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I always go back... Will Bunker, who founded match.com, he was one of my first investors for Dish Crawl, and sometimes his voice is still in my head saying things. For example, he always made this comment about making the donuts. You're successful if you're making the donuts and you just got to keep making the donuts. Meaning...</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         You show up.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Well, yeah, it's like entrepreneurs, for example, they want to start something, and then they get bored and they want to start something else. But when you become a successful business, you are doing the same thing over and over and over again, and a lot of times, that to an entrepreneur is boring. But unless you keep doing the same thing, the thing over and over and over again, and getting really good at it, then you're never going to actually grow. So, that was really interesting to me, and I still think about that to this day.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I think culture is so important. I remember my first company, and one of the reasons why I started my first company was because I was in corporate and there were these really catty girls who would be like, \"Oh my god, it's five and she's not in the office.\" I could see the look on their face, and I'm like, \"my god, do you guys not have anything else better to do in your life?\"</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, get a hobby.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah, exactly. This is one of the motivations for wanting to start my own business, and we grew so fast. We're like, \"Okay, we need to actually hire like five people in the next whatever,\" like in the next week, basically, we needed to hire five people. Granted, we're doing that right now, but it's so different. What ended up happening was I wasn't actually involved in some of the key hires that we were doing. So, I ended up going into the office and creating this... I created the culture that I didn't want, this culture where there were these three girls and they had this attitude, like, \"Oh, you can't sit with us.\" It's like, \"Oh my god, what the heck just happened?\" I'm going into my own company feeling like there's these catty girls now, again.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Like a high school lunch room, basically, right?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yes. It was so terrible. So, that's one of the most important things for me. Even now, we're growing to 60 now, and I'm still involved in the hiring. I still want to make sure that the people are the right fit, because I never want that to happen again. So, what we've been able to create with the culture at This Dot is just, everybody wants to grow from each other. Everybody is a teacher. Everybody wants to mentor. Everybody believes in helping each other grow as individuals.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah. Everybody's got a hand out to lift people up versus trying to push them down.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah. One negative person is so hard. Also, everybody always says this, but fire fast, if it's not all working out, and I've learned that mistake over and over and over and over again.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I feel like with This Dot we've made some good decisions, so I don't have as much of this, but being a little bit younger, I mean, I did Dish Crawl for eight years. I still remember, there was these two best friends, and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, if I fire one of them, then the other one, who's really good, will leave. But then, when I ended up firing one of them, the other one who was her best friend was like, \"Thank god. Thank you so much. Now I can actually work.\" She was being such a disease to her friend at work. Those are my top things. I mean, I have so many more.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Oh, yeah, and the familiarity probably just added to that. Yeah, I was looking through this and I'm trying to come up with things to talk about, and I was like, \"Wow, we could go on for hours and hours,\" because there's so much to this.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, learning to be a web developer, it's really hot right now, and for understandable reasons. We get to work remote, we get to work at a computer, we're not outside sweating. It's a desirable field. The pay is really good. So, a lot of people are trying to figure that out and get into this market, and we always hear that there's a shortage, but at the same time, people are only hiring senior folks, is the feeling. I'm wondering, what sort of path have you seen people have success with, trying to get into this market, as web developers?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I would say just getting on Twitter and following the people in the industry has been where I see the most success, probably because I'm on Twitter.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Is that because we're on Twitter? Because I agree with the general sentiment, but is that because that's where we're at, or is that where it's at?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I think that that's where it's at, because you think about it, what other path do you have? Like, okay, you're a person looking for a job. What do you do? How do you get into companies? How do you get to know people at companies? It's almost impossible to do so without just getting on Twitter. Okay, you get on Twitter, now all of a sudden you know you want to work at Webflow. Okay, follow all the Webflow people. Start talking to them, figure out what they're excited about, get them to mentor you through the process, get them to know you. And then all of a sudden you're working at Webflow. I've seen that happen time and time again.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         There's nuance, though, right? You can't get on Twitter and just start pinging people and adding people. How does an individual that is just learning contribute value and contribute to the conversation?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          You know, it's funny because I feel like all junior developers, anytime I need a junior developer... I mean, actually, it doesn't even have to be a junior developer. Everybody is always like, \"Oh, I'm not working on anything that interesting. I don't know. I don't have anything to say,\" but you'd be surprised. One of my friends, she's working on Angular and .NET. Man, I know you're working on some really hard problems, and there's not a lot of people talking about best practices when doing Angular and .NET integration or whatever.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Or even good practices, not even necessarily best, good practices.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Exactly, like do's and don'ts. I was laughing and I was like, \"How about you just write a blog post called Don'ts?\" [crosstalk 00:18:08] Because she's struggling a lot with some things within her organization. I'll tell you how I got started. One of my co-founders [inaudible 00:18:17], I had been coding for maybe three months, and he said, \"Hey, why don't you come share your experiences on this Ember meetup online?\" I said, \"Okay.\" And then, I just shared what I knew. That gave me confidence, and I was like, \"Oh, I could do this. Okay, people find this interesting.\" And then, for a good year, I just learned new technologies and shared what I learned.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         When I started, it was very similar. I was learning and struggling, and I wanted to do this career, but I couldn't just switch because I couldn't take the pay hit, I have kids and stuff. What I did was I would solve something, like find a problem, do my research, solve it for myself, then just write about it. Write the problem, write the solution, write the problem, write the solution, over and over again, and that was writing for me. I would post them on Twitter or whatever, when that came around, but that process, and then open source. I got into open source and started just writing documentation, because I wasn't able to follow and contribute, but I was able to contribute at a different level.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah. Documentation. I mean, literally any person you talk to who does open source, or any person you talk to who has been successful in the industry, their first answer will always be documentation. I think when junior developers hear that, they're like, \"Yeah, whatever,\" but, I mean, if every single person you talk to is saying start with the docs, it's probably a good path.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         It carries, too, it's like as senior developers or people with experience, you still should be participating in that at some level. Whether it's writing documentation to make onboarding easier when you're trying to scale, or recording screencasts, or... It takes a bunch of different forms, but this ability to communicate gets back to the idea of a Tenex mentor to me. It's this idea that throughout your entire career, you're acquiring knowledge, sharing knowledge, and using that to help boost other people and provide value to the broader community.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah. Ben Lesh and I, I started this series called Yolo Brolo. So, yolo, and then bro, and then I don't know why lo, but anyways-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         You crack me up by the way.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          [crosstalk 00:20:19] The tagline on YouTube is Screencast of Experts Teaching Beginners. These May or May Not Be Useful. Because I swear some of them are totally not useful. Some of them are extremely useful, and we have thousands of people watching silly things about Ben teaching RxJS, and it's like small, teensy little things that he teaches me, let's say, in a screencast, that you don't realize that a lot of people just don't know. So, the more you think you don't know, the more you're just holding back on us. You need to teach everybody else.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         My joke, lately, that I've been using, is that statistically speaking, nobody on the planet earth even knows HTML, much less, you start talking about our RxJS or these more complicated topics, but literally, you have something to share. We all have something to share. We all have our individual voice, or our take on it, or the path that we took to learn something. It's interesting, and the more we share... I don't know about you, but this broadcast culture that we've kind of stumbled into over the last three years, with Twitch, and YouTube, and this live recording of what I'm kind of referring to as slow content versus more edited content, there's nuggets in this, and it's really, really interesting to watch this evolve, to me.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          The slow content movement, like the slow food movement, but slow content.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, well, people want to kick back, like in Egghead, if there's a criticism of our approach, it's that they're these really tightly edited, concise, kind of punch you in the face videos, and that's fine, it's a good format, but people also just want to, like after work, or while they're learning, or at lunch, just chill and watch people have conversations, and joke, and laugh, and be whimsical, and I love the way you and Ben... Y'all's chemistry is amazing, and just the way that that comes across is really inspiring and interesting, and I think useful to the broad population, too.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         You keep a list on Twitter, and I know it goes beyond the Twitter list, and it's the Fempire list. This is a list of women in software development that completely changed my Twitter feed and kind of how I look at the industry in a profound way. I literally went through and ran a script, and I followed everybody, and then I've kind of pared it back, because you got to prune Twitter to make it useful. But I followed everybody. It was like 900 people at the time, and just blew my list completely out of the water, and then unfollowed a whole swath of people at the same time that I'd previously been following, and changed my perspective of the industry. I'm wondering, where does that start, where does that come from, and why do you have a Twitter list called Fempire, and what does that mean?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          It started mainly because I just wanted to keep track of all the woman I've met, so it wasn't even anybody important, or exciting, or whatever. It's just random women that I've met throughout my journeys. I love that everybody just started following people in the Fempire list, because who are they? It's not like they're important for any specific reason, potentially. Right. It was so fun when I started that list because people would just be like, \"Oh my gosh, I just got a thousand followers. What's going on?\" And then they'd be like, \"Oh, we followed you through Tracy's list.\" I was like, \"Wow, this is so cool to see.\" So, that's really where it started, just because I just wanted to create a list of interesting women, and then it just got bigger and bigger and bigger. So, I keep adding to it. I mean, I obviously can't add everyone to it, just because that would be like a full-time job.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          But I also have a GitHub. It's github.com/fempire, and there's a speakers list of women, where people can just submit PRs for interesting women in their communities.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Oh, nice, crowdsourcing.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah, and that's just a really good way, if you want to find a speaker in India or whatever, you can find like all the woman in tech who are interested. Also organizers, finding all the woman organizers of different tech communities.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I really love empowering woman. If I had to think about my journey, so, when I was 21 or so I was in this abusive relationship, and then what I wanted to do was I did jewelry. So, when you get into relationships like that, it's all about that person disempowering you, so you feel like you can't do anything, you're stuck. So, for me, it was really important to be able to get a job, and get back on track, and have my own life again and not be dependent on somebody.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, that's important.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah. And so, I've always felt very strongly about that. I had a jewelry business, and I was like, \"Okay, do I go to like women's shelters and teach them how to make jewelry as a way of empowering them on how, basically, their hands can be the way they get out of this relationship, their hands can be their way to empower them to make money, et cetera.\" So, with Dish Crawl, who likes food and events? Women, mostly. So, it was a very large, 95% women on our team. So, that was interesting.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          And then, going into tech, and going really deep into JavaScript, it's weird that it's kind of happened again. I'm in a place again where I'm like, \"Wow, there are so many amazing woman in tech. How do we empower them? How do we help junior developers get jobs?\" We started an apprentice program at This Dot, but it's really just part of me being excited about I think just women in general, and trying to help lift each other up. We shouldn't be tearing each other down.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         There's the idea of taking up space, and putting it out there, and being present, and I really like that. I appreciate it, and I appreciate you taking the time to educate people like myself and help us push forward too, because I think what you're doing is really inspirational. I look to that, and I look, to it for guidance, and it changes my perspective and I think other people's perspective too.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          That's great.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, I think that's super valuable across the board. So, thank you for your work. [crosstalk 00:25:59] Really appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I'm curious, because you mentioned your apprenticeship program for women trying to get into this, and how does that work? What does that look like, and how do you operate an apprenticeship program?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          When I started the apprentice program, here's what was happening. This is why it started. I constantly got people asking me how they hire more women in tech, and then I get all these junior developers who are women, who have just gotten out of bootcamps, looking for jobs. And so, there's this disconnect between, you mentioned it, everybody wanting to hire a senior developer. And so, I was thinking, okay, there's all these jobs and then there's junior developers, so there's this weird disconnect. And so, what if we created a program that helped solve all these problems? So, the apprentice program was really created as a way to take all the excuses out of the business, for their reason of not hiring woman developers.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          What we do is we actually pair a junior developer and a senior developer together on projects, so you combine them as a pair, and it's this idea where you can work with a junior female developer and her mentor for the course of three months to a year, on contract, and then you can hire them directly once they're ready. So, they're trained on your tech stack, they're not taking away from your senior developers because they have a PM/senior developer making sure that they're contributing and they're bringing value immediately. Hopefully, that helps the integration part, the onboarding part, which is typically the most difficult with junior developers, so they can be productive, and once they're productive on your tech stack, then you can just hire them directly.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, because the problem is two-fold. The employer wants productive employees, but people that want jobs, we all, I think for the most part, want to be on a job, be productive, and see success. We don't want to be just floundering and confused the entire time. So, it solves it on both ends of the spectrum. How do I go from not having production experience to being experienced and comfortable to where I can make a contribution as well?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          It is so hard, I have to tell you. It makes me so sad to see, first off, bootcamps. I mean-</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         The drama?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Not all bootcamps are created equal. It's like, \"Okay, I went to bootcamp,\" but there is a huge difference based on the bootcamp you go to. Now, I can't tell you which bootcamps to go to, and I won't mention any, but I can definitely say some graduates of different bootcamps, we've tried to get them through the apprentice program, but it's so hard, because some bootcamps just don't even teach the fundamentals.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I've seen a lot of bootcamp call-outs on Twitter lately. I'm not trying to pan anybody specifically, but it's like, do your research and find people that have gone to the bootcamp, and ask them directly what their experience was. Specifically, I've heard this advice for women and other marginalized groups, that you need to find people like you and talk to them about their experiences, because that is also a factor in a lot of these circumstances.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Well, I'll tell you about my bootcamp experience.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         I'd love to hear it.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          So, I took a JavaScript class after I was surrounded by tons of JavaScript experts. So, my teacher, he was like, \"Oh, okay, I'm going to teach you CSS, but I don't really like CSS.\" This was four or five years ago, and I was like, \"Oh, yeah, what do you think of ESX?\" And he's like, \"What is that?\" And I'm thinking, \"Dude, if I know more than you, no, this is not a thing.\" So, they actually refunded me.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         That's a pretty good case for it, too. It's like, if you go into... And, you know, not all created equal. I think that's fundamentally the point here, and do your research.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          For sure. Definitely.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         So, to wrap this out, I was wondering, do you have any favorite book or other resource that was pivotal for you in your journey as both an entrepreneur or a developer? Something that changed the way you think?</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Oh, that is such a hard question.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, and it's a prize one.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          I know, I can't remember the name. It's by this Andreessen Horowitz guy, but that was probably my favorite book, Ben Horowitz, The Hard Things about Hard Things.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Oh yeah, that's a good one.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah. I read so many of these different books and most of them I don't finish because I just get bored of them, but The Hard Things about Hard Things I felt like was really practical and a really easy read.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Yeah, and he talks about, you know, okay, well you got to let an employee go now, here's how I did it, and that kind of thing, but in his own stories. I really enjoyed that one quite a bit. For me lately, I just finished Thinking in Systems and it was a full mindset shift for me.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Really? Okay, I'll have to look that one up, too.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         It's a good one. It's titled as a primer, but it's the most profound and also depressing book I think I've ever read, in a lot of ways.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Okay, do I want to read it now?</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         You do. I think everybody should. I think it should be taught in like eighth grade. I think they should use it as a textbook. We really have some things to think about as a species.</p><p><strong>Joel Hooks:</strong>         Tracy, thank you so much for hanging out with me this afternoon. I really appreciate it. I'm looking forward to seeing what you do next, and talk to you soon.</p><p><strong>Tracy Lee:</strong>          Yeah, thank you.</p>",

    "transcript": "**Joel Hooks:**         Hi Molly.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       How's it going, Joel?\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         It's going great. How are you doing today?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       I'm doing good.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, I'm really excited to talk to you because lately it seems like, over the last year or so, I keep hearing this term, site reliability engineer, or SRE, and a you are a lead SRE, and I wanted to find out more about that, but I kind of wanted to break the ice and ask you about your relationship with horses and what you do outside of that, because I don't know a lot of people that interact with those fine beasts, and I was wondering how you got into that and what that's all about.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yeah, that's actually quite a common reaction I get when I say, \"`Oh, by the way, in my free time I ride horses.\" [inaudible 00:00:44], \"Oh, wow. How'd you get into that?\" Honestly, I've been riding since I was five years old. My aunt got me a riding lesson and the rest was history. I kind of fell in love and I've been doing it ever since. So, it's something that gives me a nice break away from the computers, and it's outside, and the fact that you get to work with a live animal is also super rewarding. So, it's something I've enjoyed my whole life, and lucky for me, it's kind of a lifetime sport. You can do it well into your 60s, 70s, I've seen 80-year-olds ride. So, it's something that I can do for the rest of my life, which is nice.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         And you have your own horse, or horses.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yes, horses. So, I'm very lucky, my in-laws are also into horses, and so, I ride a lot of theirs and yeah, it works out great.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         I understand, like if you spend a lot of time with them, I mean, there's a relationship, right? They're intelligent animals, and they know you, and respond to you, and that sort of thing. Is that true?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Exactly. When you're out there, it's not like a bike, where you buy a bike off the shelf and it's going to respond to what you say. When you go out and look for a horse, it's kind of similar to looking for a house. You got to look for one that meets your needs, that is going to get along with you. It's a team sport out there, it's you and the horse, and if you can't communicate, you could have the best horse and the best rider, and if they can't get on the same page, it's going to be a disaster. So, it's definitely kind of fun to experience horses and their different quirks, and figuring it all out.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, I mean, it's like any sort of of animal companion is kind of that way, right? If you don't match, then you kind of have to just live with each other, and it's no good [crosstalk 00:02:25].\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Exactly.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         They don't like it either, if they don't like their human, I imagine.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, what is a site reliability engineer? What's an SRE?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       To me, a site reliability engineer is a software engineer, but with their focus on performance and reliability. It's also usually a software engineer that has some other little area of expertise, so you could think of maybe a software engineer who's really good with MySQL, and really good with databases. Maybe they're really good with Linux. So, kind of the way I like to describe it and also how our operations describe it is a developer plus. So, it's a dev, but they've got a little bit of something extra in there that just helps them kind of step back and look at the whole system and ensure that it's performing and reliable.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Does it have anything to do with, like, we have DevOps, right? Is being an SRE, is it somehow related to to DevOps, or would that be like the plus that maybe you have as an SRE?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, I would view that, my opinion personally is that that would be the plus. I view site reliability engineers as basically, like I said, software engineers, but their focus is different than delivering features. DevOps to me always was less coding and more on the operations focus, so that's kind of how I see the difference between SRE and DevOps. Now, there are some people that just, they lump them all together and they assume that it's the same thing. My view is that the SREs are much more software-focused to solve problems, where DevOps is kind of more operations-focused.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, I know you went to school and you studied aerospace engineering, so I know you didn't necessarily look at web development as your path, and I assume you obviously didn't look at being an SRE as your path, but how did you go from getting into web development to becoming a site reliability engineer?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, like you said, I started in web development and started as a software engineer, and basically what happened is I joined Kenna four years ago, and when I joined them, one of our lead engineers, who was in charge of Elasticsearch, left. So, I saw that as an opportunity to kind of grab a little piece of real estate there and take ownership over something. So, I grabbed onto Elasticsearch, I learned everything I could about it, and over the two years, I became the residential Elasticsearch expert. Because Elasticsearch is such a cornerstone of our platform, I naturally found myself doing a lot of those tasks to improve performance, to improve reliability, to ensure that we could scale.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, as our team grew and we started realizing that we were going to have to break up our one single dev team into multiple, our VP came to me and said, \"Hey, you kind of are already doing this. What do you think about forming a site reliability team and working on that?\" And of course, since it's something I enjoy, I enjoy those performance improvements and finding those ways to make things scale, I naturally said yes, and since that, for the past almost two years now, I've been a site reliability engineer.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, there wasn't a team already, and it was kind of built around the... I mean, I feel like people recognize the need for these sorts of things as you grow to a certain scale, like a five man shop probably isn't going to have an SRE team. So, it grows out of time and necessity, I would assume.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Definitely. So, it's definitely something that grows, for us it grew out of need, and that's kind of one other thing I like to touch on is sometimes people view SRE as something that only giant orgs have. So, because Google was kind of the one that coined the term, some people think, \"Oh my god, you got to be a big Google company before you have an SRE team.\" But I don't think that's the case. Kenna, when we broke off, our SRE team probably had 60 people, and 20 or so of them were engineers. So, we weren't that large. Ever since we've kind of broken off, my view has been you're never too small to have an SRE. It doesn't need to be a full team. It doesn't even need to be one person's sole job, but there should always be someone on a team that is focusing on those SRE things, those things like performance, those things like reliability. It's never too early to start thinking like an SRE when you're building an application or building a company.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         I kind of see the SRE, when I use my mind's eye, as almost like a firefighter, but it also feels like that's probably, while part of the job, not necessarily the full job. What else, besides the firefighting, the having the pager go off, which I want to get into a little bit too, what does the SRE do outside of that to maybe prevent fires, I suppose?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       One of the big things is you're the one that has the performance and reliability kind of on your mind all the time. So, one of the things our site reliability team does is, a lot of times when PRs from the main dev teams who are working on the features go out, we'll review them, and we are not necessarily looking for, okay, how correct is the feature or does it work properly, but we're in there and we're looking at the database requests. Are these going to be performant? Are we looping through all these records in MySQL when we don't have to? So, one of the things we do is we're looking at code and making sure all the code going out is going to be performant and going to be able to scale.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       In addition to that, other things that we work on are things like monitoring any tools, creating tools, or doing things that are going to help us scale in the future. So, we're really thinking ahead and trying to get ahead of those firefighting things when they occur. So, ideally, we would design everything and be a step ahead and we'd never have to firefight. That's not really the case all the time, but if we can prevent that as much as possible, then we're doing our job.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, last week Egghead actually, we had our sign-in form just attacked, like there were like some sort of botnet or something just attacking our form. Is that the kind of thing that a site reliability engineer would focus on, too? Is the idea of external forces coming in and taking you out of the norm, like taking you out of your normal day to day?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yeah, so that is something our SRE team does, but also the devs need to be aware of that as well. But we actually, it's funny you say that sign-up form, because we actually had a tester come in and see what would happen if they signed up a thousand clients, and it backed up our email. And so, that was something where we had to jump in and be like, okay, how do we flush this email queue and get everything back to normal, and then how do we handle the situation where, okay, if someone comes in and maliciously tries to sign up a thousand users or whatever, how do we handle that? So, that's definitely something that is on our radar, but also is not exclusively SRE. The devs also are kind of thinking about that as well.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         When trying to make lemonade out of the lemons, I said, \"Well, we got testing for free, and pen testing is expensive.\" They were signing up 6,000 emails an hour.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Ooh.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, it was interesting. It was fun for me. I guess we're a very small team, so I kind of end up being our site reliability engineer sometimes. It's like a puzzle, but then it pops up and you're also like, \"Well, is this going to just ruin the entire business?\" I'm a big fan of this entire concept of being a reliability engineer, I think it's great. What's the path, is it just, you said pick a specialty, and I'm kind of wondering, if somebody's in a position and they don't have an SRE team, how do you pitch that or what's kind of the dev boots on the ground sales pitch to form an SRE team in an organization?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yeah, it's definitely, it's one of the hardest things to pitch because usually the upper execs, they see features and they see features translate into dollars. But what SRE translates to is it translates to reliability in the platform. It translates to, as a lot of people say, the nines. You can have all the great features in the world, but if they're only working 50% of the time, none of your clients are going to be happy.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, luckily for us, kind of early on we had scaling issues, so when the idea came up to have an SRE team to get ahead of further scaling issues, it was easier to sell, mainly because we had had the scaling issues in the past. Ideally, you want to get ahead of the scaling issues and kind of get the SRE mindset going even before, but it's the fact that you have to basically push that performance and reliability, especially in this day and age.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       The expectations for websites are so high these days that if you're not performant and reliable, people write you off. It's like when you go into Instagram or something, if it kind of starts freezing on you, if you have to wait two or three seconds to click around, I mean, you're going to probably shut the app and assume that it's buggy, or come back at a later time. So, these days you definitely have to make sure the performance is there if you want to keep those users.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, I often think of Google.com, the primary search product of Google, and how just lightning fast it is all the time, every day, and it's giving you results that are contextual, it gives you all sorts of different components, and everyday it's just lightning fast, and if it wasn't, their core product would be fundamentally broken.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yeah. And you can even think about it, if you get on a slow connection and you Google something, because the connection is slow, it takes a few seconds, and it's amazing how adapted we are to the speed of the internet these days, because when things slow down, you're like, \"Oh my god, oh my god, I can't deal with this. I have to wait so long.\" It's so noticeable just because we're so used to it being so fast.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, one of my favorite quotes recently, I was reading the wonderful book from Will Larson-called An Elegant Puzzle, and he says systems generally won't scale past one order of magnitude of growth. I've heard from you on another podcast, that was kind of the case with the system that you work on, that you were growing, and your growth has been such that the system has basically had to churn out. I'm wondering, is that your experience, and how do you deal with that from a reliability standpoint?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       I would say definitely in the beginning, our system was one of those systems that there was no way we could scale by orders of magnitude. We have come a long way, even in the past two, three years, that because we focus so much on the reliability of the system and the performance, I have salespeople come up to me and they've got these big clients, and they go, \"Molly, what do you think, how big can we go? How much data can you handle?\" Right now, honestly, my answer is, \"I don't know, keep shoving it in there.\" We've multiplied and we've increased our data by four times since we did a bunch of our ES performance improvements, and it hasn't slowed down yet, it keeps chugging.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, we're going to hit the next bottleneck at some point, and we do hit little bottlenecks along the way, and as we do, we figure them out. But I think if you have, like I said, that SRE mindset from the beginning, and you take care to build your code in a way that will scale, you can achieve and make an application that is going to be scalable or easier to scale in the future.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, I've played with Elasticsearch a little bit, and we even used it in a production for a while and ended up just kind of punting. Now we use Algolia because we didn't have anybody that was dedicated to to running Elasticsearch. I was wondering, what is Elasticsearch and what is it used for beyond the obvious, being in its name, search. What is that tool, what's its primary function?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Elasticsearch, as you said, its primary goal is for searching, but not just searching in the sense that you think, \"Okay, I'm going to enter a word and it's going to tech search.\" It is able to do so much more, to build the sidebars that you see where you can select like, I want all tags with this, I want everything that's after this date, et cetera. So, those are formed using what Elasticsearch calls aggregations. And so, Elasticsearch has the ability to really just take your data, and you can slice and dice and run all sorts of different metrics on it, just through Elasticsearch, and it is incredibly fast.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       That's kind of one thing that has set Kenna apart from a lot of our competitors, is we give our clients the ability to really just break down their data in so many unique ways, and quickly. I guess other competitors, from what I've heard from our CTO who started the company, when someone runs a search on their platforms, it can take hours or days for that search to run, and what Elasticsearch does is it gives you the ability to run that search in a second or less, and at scale.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, it's definitely something that it is unique, it is extremely powerful, but as we found out kind of the hard way, it's one of those where it's easy to get started. You can throw a bunch of data in there, it stands up and it's fast, but to get it at scale, that is harder, and that's why I've written a blog post and I've done talks on scaling Elasticsearch, because that's literally what we did. We threw everything in Elasticsearch and it was fast when we had 500,000 documents. No problem. But when we have 4 billion, we had to be much more careful and much more cognizant of how we were using it. So, it's one of those, it's easy to learn, but it's hard to master.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, I mean, I got in there and over the weekend I was like, \"Oh, look at this. I know Elasticsearch,\" and then over time it was like trying to maintain it, and something would break, or getting good results, or the whole thing. It's just impressive to me how it's used, because it's a wonderful tool and they made it really approachable for the first mile, but becoming a true expert in making it reliable and useful for specific use cases or specific business needs and outcomes, that's a totally different story.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       100%, 100%. There's only so much you can just attribute to the black box. Sometimes you actually got to go in there and figure out what's going on.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         I think maybe if you pay attention, that's true for a lot of these tools that we use, across the board, and actually is kind of the story of this field.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, part of being an SRE, I think, that I would associate it with, anyway, is the the idea of being on-call of PagerDuty or even a physical phone attached to your job. I think that's associated in a lot of ways in a negative context and can be really grueling. Is that true? Is that part of being an SRE, is the on-call aspect?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       In my perspective, on-call is an aspect of every software engineer. And so, the way we do it as Kenna is it's not just SREs on-call, all the devs are on-call, as well as operations. So, it can be grueling, but the way we've set it up at Kenna is the SREs kind of own their alerts and their things that are going to alarm, and then the dev teams, on the flip-side, own other alerts that are kind of based around the code base and things that they've built. What ends up happening is that you end up with four or five people actually on-call at once. So, we have an on-call person for basically every team. What that does, is one, it gives you a lot of on-call reps.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, I think one of the things that can be grueling about on-call sometimes is if you don't go on-call a lot, you don't get a lot of practice. And so, you're not really comfortable when those alarms go off. So, one thing that breaking it up into smaller teams and smaller rotations does is it allows people to be on-call more often, which gives them more reps, and so they're more comfortable with it. And the second thing is because we have multiple people on-call all the time, no one ever feels like they're alone. There's no time where the alarms are going off and you have nobody that you can reach out to. I think that's gone a long way into making it a lot less grueling and a lot less tedious, because when those alarms go off and everything's kind of going wrong, the last thing you want to do is feel like you're in there alone.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, it's like stage fright and anxiety all kind of bundled up.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Exactly. It's hard to get on stage by yourself, but if you spring three of your best friends up there with you, suddenly it's a lot more relaxing. And so, those are two things that we have done to really kind of make on-call suck less. And I've actually, I wrote a blog post on it because I think it's one of those things that a lot of devs find very stressful, and before we overhauled our on-call system, our devs hated it, and now they've completely bought into it, and they feel a sense of ownership over what they're supporting, and that goes a long way into making, like I said, on-call suck less, because it shouldn't be something that is a horrible experience. Sure, it might be hard at times, but you shouldn't dread it all the time.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Like any system, right? We can design our on-call system to be efficient and something that is useful and that nobody really dreads and it's just part of your job...\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Exactly.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         ... or you can have something where it's essentially torturing and burning out a limited subset of your coworkers or employees.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. So, if I want to build reliable and resilient systems, where do I start? If I'm sitting down to to build an app, what are the primary things that I need to take into consideration when I'm thinking about that?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       One of the first things, I think, when you're building an application, is first and foremost, as you're building it, you one, you want to kind of keep things as simple as possible. Never get overly complicated, because complicated code is where you'll usually run into issues in terms of scaling, and then in terms of when you bring other people on.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       In addition to that, as you're building an application, it can be very easy to kind of get into the weeds. You think, \"Oh, okay, I got my application, I want to build feature A.\" So, you build feature A. Then feature B comes in. You're like, \"Okay, I'm going to build feature B.\" So, you build feature B. Feature C comes in, you build that. A lot of times, if you're just focused on just the feature you're building, you'll lose the context of the overall application.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       And so, one of the easiest things you can do when you start building an application, is constantly taking a step back and looking at how all the pieces fit together, and thinking of that application as a whole. What that's going to allow you to do, it's going to allow you to think about things like scale, think about things like performance. It can be very easy to kind of get into the rabbit hole of thinking, \"Okay, I got feature A that I want to turn out, and as long as feature A is good and it works, then boom, we're good to go.\" But at the same time, you need to be stepping back and be like, \"Okay, we've got feature A, B, and C here. How do these all fit together? If they're all going at once, how does my database react to that? Can they all run together happily, or is there going to be some fighting over resources?\" So, keeping that big picture in mind is kind of one of the best things you can do as you are building an application.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, how does documentation come into this? I assume that part of the idea would be also to knowledge share, right? Like knowledge transfer. Is documentation internally an important part of this?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Oh my god. Documentation is huge, and it's one of those things where when you're small, especially at small companies, you just don't think about it. You've got five of you standing around and your computers, everyone kind of knows what's going on, and so, you don't think of docs. We didn't start thinking about it at Kenna until we probably had 10 plus engineers, and we started bringing on engineers quickly, and at that point we realized that there was a lot of knowledge that was up in our heads that we then had to get to all these new hires, and having to tell new hires over and over again the same information is not ideal when you're trying to grow a team quickly. So, that point is, that's when we realized, \"Okay, we got to start writing this down.\"\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, what documentation does is one, it allows you to bring on people faster, and two, it avoids that issue of tribal knowledge, of having one person just have all of the knowledge in their head and it not written down. That's never good. You never know when someone's going to leave, you never know what's going to happen. And so, having that information written down is huge. And kind of one of the ways... I saw a talk at Ruby Conf last year, and this kind of helped kickstart us in terms of really getting our documentation up to date. One of the things the girl suggested was to put expiration dates on your documents.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, in all of our documentation, every document has an expiration on it and it's usually about three months out from when the document was written. Then it's the job of the developer, the next person that goes, if they look at that document and the expiration date has expired, it's their job to make sure everything on it is up to date and still relevant, and if it is, then they push the expiration date out again three months. And so, that really allows everybody to kind of participate in keeping docs up to date, and that, for us, has been huge in helping us one, keep the docs up to date, because we're growing and changing so quickly, and everyone's bought in to making sure we have sufficient docs.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         I think for most people, the idea of documentation isn't a sexy or fun work that comes with being a developer, right? We all love puzzles, for the most part, developers I talk to like the puzzle aspect, and docs aren't really a puzzle, but they're so critical. I know we're a tiny team, and we have this handful of documentation, and when you go and somebody's no longer with the company or something, and then you go back and it's actually documented, it's like the most warming feeling, and the exact opposite is true when you go to something, you don't understand it, and there's no documentation, you just don't know what's going on. Everything is intentional in a system, every line of code was added intentionally by a human, and why?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Exactly.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         I know you have built some and work on internal tools, and there was something that really struck my interest that I've heard you speak about, and it's Mr. Radar. Can you tell me what Mr. Radar is and what that does for your company?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, Mr. Radar was built out of the need to monitor our data. We have your standard test suite, we have standard continuous integration set up, so every time code changes are made, we run the specs, we make sure everything passes, and then deploy the code. Well, as we were getting more and more data and more and more clients, we started realizing that our code working was only half the picture. The other half was the data, and making sure the data was correct. And so, early on we actually had some issues with the data being correct, and that is how Mr. Radar was born.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       What Mr. Radar does is it's basically a set of what we call antennas, and they run via a cron job in the background, and it basically goes into our databases and it checks on a bunch of different things to ensure that the data is correct, and anytime it finds data inconsistencies, it alerts us to those so that we can go and investigate them and figure out what caused them.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         The impetus for building a custom tool, is it because there's nothing exists, or just the specific needs of your application and your users, or what motivates the building of a custom tool beyond just, like you said, you need to test for the data and whether it's accurate?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       What motivated it for us is that it was a pretty simple problem to solve. It really just involved, \"Okay, let's make a couple MySQL queries here. If we get numbers back we don't expect, well, trigger an alert.\" So, it wasn't something involved that we really needed a lot of something fancy for, it was simple enough that we wanted to create it ourselves, and then we would have full control over it, and we could kind of tweak it and do with it what we pleased. And so, I think that's what drove us to create it ourselves rather than going outside and looking for another solution. At the same time, we were also really small at that point, so you kind of want to do things as cheaply as possible, and like I said, because it was a simple tool, it was like, we'll just build it ourselves.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         I try to be cognizant of the idea of not invented here. There are good ideas externally and we don't have to invent everything ourselves, but sometimes it just makes so much sense to build your own tools, and then, specifically, for the control, I'm a little bit of a control freak.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Sometimes I just want to have full control of my platform or the tooling therein.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         When is the right time to break things out of a system? As it grows, like your system's growing, you are building a large application, and you start breaking pieces off, whether it's a tool like Mr. Robot, or extracting something into an external service. How do you go about that thought process and deciding when to do that sort of activity?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       So, that, I think, happens... It's different for everyone. At Kenna, we have done it four times. The first time we did we had code written that needed to get rewritten, and it had a very specific functionality that was very isolated in our application. And so, that's when we decided, \"Okay, we need to rewrite this code and it's already super isolated. Why not break it out?\" So, I think that's one kind of indication that you might have a service on your hands, is if you already have something that's naturally isolated in your code base, it's not reaching out and touching a bunch of things, that's kind of a good indication, like, \"Okay, maybe we could separate this.\"\n\n**Molly Struve:**       And then beyond that, a lot of it has been driven by performance and usability by the devs. So, usually when we hit a performance bottleneck somewhere, we'll kind of look at it... For example, say our main application, the deploys are taking too long because we have to deploy to 20 sidekick servers that are running. Okay. Well, what do those sidekick servers do? They're processing background data. Huh. Is that something we could separate so that our main application can deploy faster, and then we can do all of our data processing separately? When you get to bottlenecks like that, I think those can have a lot of impact on driving when you break things out.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       I'm definitely a big proponent of not over-complicating things and not just looking at a system and being like, \"Okay, how many pieces can we break that into?\" Because I think that leads to unnecessary complexity. I like when it happens more organically, and it feels more natural in that sense.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         It adds complications to monitoring and being able to observe your overall system, like if you get into too tiny of pieces. It's like the right level of abstraction for the needs of the system, I would think.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So, to kind of switch topics here and close this out, what are your current favorite communities related to software development, on the internet?\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Oh, great question. So, my favorite is dev.to, and I recently started blogging on that back in December, and it's been fabulous. I've really enjoyed... Basically, the community in general is very approachable and just wonderful to work with. I've written some posts on there that were kind of hard to write and were very personal to me, and the response has been amazing. In addition to that, I also enjoy Twitter, which I think is kind of a surprise to a lot of people, because a lot of people think, \"Oh my god, there's so much crap on Twitter.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         It's true.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       But I think if you are really cognizant of who you're following and who you're not, it can actually be a really great experience. Don't follow people who are negative, don't follow people if they're like raging politicians or something. I think if you just really focus, and you follow those that embrace your kind of ideals, and tweet about things you're interested in, which in my case it's software. My Twitter is purely software-driven. You look on my Instagram, you're going to see all ponies and dogs. You look at my Twitter, it's going to be all software. So, I think it's kind of what you make it, and if you're really cognizant about who you're following, you can actually kind of have a great experience on Twitter, in my opinion.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         I love Twitter, too, and I also love dev.to, but Twitter to me, and this is how I explain it to people who maybe have a better time on Twitter, it's like a bonsai tree, and it's your space. People talk about, well you don't want to live necessarily in a bubble, and I think that's true to an extent, but also, your own personal happiness is important, too. So, the extent that the bubble helps you and you get what you need and want out of it, that's it. You don't have to follow celebrities or politicians, or you can use it to follow your community, which is how I've always used it and enjoy it as well.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yeah, definitely.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Well Molly, I really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. It was truly a pleasure, and look forward to seeing what you're up to next.\n\n**Molly Struve:**       Yes, thanks for having me.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Cheers.",

    "description": "To executives, new features mean more money, but even if you had terrific features, they wouldn't be worth a thing if they only worked half the time. Reliability isn't something you want to put off until later after the project has grown, it will save you a lot of time and money if you factor it in from day one. Everyone has adapted to a speedy internet these days. Users leave if the site is taking more than even a few seconds to load. \n\nIt's easy to get overly focused on features while losing the context of the overall application. The first and foremost solid you can do future you is to keep things as simple as possible. Never get overly complicated, that's where you run into scaling troubles. Complexity also causes significant headaches when bringing other people on. \n\nIn addition to keeping complexity low, make sure documentation gets written and that it's kept up to date. A solution that Molly's company has put in place to keep the docs fresh is to give every document an expiration date three months out from when it gets written. When someone references the docs, they check if it's past the expiration date, if it is they go through and make sure that the information is still current, and afterward extending the expiration date another three months.  \n\n---\n\n### Transcript\n[\"Build Performant And Reliable Applications With Molly Struve\" Transcript](https://egghead.simplecast.com/episodes/build-performant-and-reliable-applications-with-molly-struve/transcript)\n\n### Quotes\n> \"To me, a site reliability engineer is a software engineer, but with their focus on performance and reliability.\"\n\n> \"So, it's a dev, but they've got a little bit of something extra in there that just helps them kind of step back and look at the whole system and ensure that it's performing and reliable.\"\n\n> \"There's only so much you can just attribute to the black box.

    "transcript": "**Joel Hooks:**         Hey Justin.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     What's going on? What's going on? What's up?\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         How you doing today?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Good, man. Just can't complain, just making it. Another day, another dollar.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So I'm really excited, you're organizing a conference and I want to get into what you're doing in Atlanta, and what's going on with your conference, but I kind of wanted to take it back a second and just ask you, how did you get into web development? How did you become a web developer and what was your path?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     I went the more traditional route, kind of. I went the college route where I started school at the University of New Haven in Connecticut. I started school as a chemistry major actually.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Oh, okay.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. So I was like completely off of the whole IT route. Just for some context, I did grow up in the MySpace days, so I used to be one of them kids who used to charge people to make themes and everything like that. I was just writing CSS and editing at the time, but I didn't really know that though. So a couple years later ... Not a couple years, but a whole decade after that, that's when I began school, and I was a chemistry major like I said. And I was like, \"Okay, this is cool and all, but I really can't picture myself doing this for the rest of my life.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Being a chemist, right?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. Because it got pretty boring. I was getting A's in the classes, but I was like, \"This is boring as hell to me.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So I ended up switching to business, and then I ended up switching schools to Mississippi State University. So after I switched there, I was in School of Business, and I remember I was like, \"Okay, this is cool but I don't really like this.\" Then I switched over to a major in culinary, and I was doing culinary, and I was like, \"This is cool as well, and-\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         You were really trying to find yourself, weren't you?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah, man. So to make a long story short, I switched an additional three more times. And I recall the day, it was me and a friend named Chris Butler. And both of us were walking past this poster, and he was a computer engineer major at the time there. And the poster was like, \"Do you like to do CSS, and do you like to do HTML and everything?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, that sounds dope as hell.\" And I went and talked to my academic advisor and said, \"I want to switch to that.\" And it was business information systems. So I ended up switching into that, and I ended up getting a minor in computer science too.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Oh, okay. So what's business information systems? Is that like web development for business, or like enterprise web development? What is a business information system?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So I call it the art of business and computer science blended. So you're going to learn business-y stuff, like how to do like accounting, how to do payroll, how to do thread analysis. But at the same time, you're going to learn how to do like computer science-y things. You're going to learn how to program. You're going to learn how to be an analyst, things like that.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So you learn the middle ground, that way no one could really get over on you on either side of the coin. But the only issue is that while the business side, you learn a crap ton, the IT side of it or the program side you don't learn as thorough. So that's why I did the whole a minor in CS, so I could go back and forth with other engineers too.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. And then I know you worked a little bit on a master's degree, and you kind of switched to something described as instructional technology. So that's almost another flip of what you're pursuing and learning too. Is that true?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. So what happened with that was, I actually got employed by the school my first day after graduation.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Oh, nice.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. So they hired me one day after graduation as a full time web dev. I highly recommend to anybody listening, do not go to work ASAP after you graduate, because I about burned out.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Take a little time?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. I was burned out. I kid you not. I had graduated on a Friday. I began working that Monday, and honestly it's because I had bills to pay.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So once you graduate, you can't work for the school in the same capacity as prior, because I was a student worker in the IT department. So I started working there, and they were like, \"Hey, we like everybody who works for us to be highly educated, so why don't you get your master's degree?\" I was like, \"Nah, I'm done with school.\" And then they were like, \"Well it's free of charge.\" And I was like, \"Yeah-\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         \"Oh, okay.\"\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. \"But I got to take a test, and I got a place in,\" and then they were like, \"No, you really don't got to. There's a couple fields that you could just choose to get into.\" So I was like, \"Okay, I got the business side down, I got the computer science side down, I need to get the IT side down now. I mean, not the IT, but the teaching IT side down.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, instructional technology, right?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. So I was like, \"Cool.\" I could kind of teach people now how to do things and how to use tech basically, which I enjoy doing to this day because I still mentor people in. Even when I was in school, I was a party association for computer machinery, and I was the head tutor for a good year and a half, I want to say.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         It's a good combo though. Computers, business, and teaching people, and passing on information. I think it's a trifecta, right? It's a killer combo.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     That was my goal, and I didn't complete it, because I ended up quitting that job and working for a private company now.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         You're a web developer, and I suspect you have opinions, and I'm wondering, what are you using in terms of your stack now? What's your preferred set of tools?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Cool. Yeah, so at my job right now I do, React is on the front end of anything that we do. Back end wise, we use a C Sharp. So I do a lot of C Sharp, when I have to, but mostly my team keeps me on the front end of things. Other than that, I'm pretty open to everything else, man. I mean, I don't have no strong opinions on this language is better than this, or this or that. I will give a full transparency though that I am not a big fan of Angular, because I came from Angular One. So I began my journey, truly, when I was about to graduate, and I started in Angular. And I had terrible time in it. And yeah, that's how I discovered React. So I've been in React since 2014 about.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. So you were working in Angular, and then you see React, and it spoke to you. It felt better to you, I guess?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah, I mean Angular, I feel like you had to learn so much of their own way of thinking, and I don't call it agnostic at all. I feel like you had to do it their way or the highway. Now I've heard that isn't true anymore, but I just haven't gone back to check it out. But I loved React, because I already knew JavaScript. So I was like, \"Hey, here's some tools that you could just wrap around your JavaScript and you could make things better.\" And they say, \"Oh, this makes complete sense.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. I've heard the argument Angular is more of a framework, where React is a toolkit, which I think the lines are so blurred. On Egghead, we actually call React a framework because ... Whatever. But at the same time, React gives you immense freedom with way less constraints. I think that's one of the big appeals.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. I mean that's very true. And for me, so going back to my friend, Chris Butler, he ran into an issue when he worked at Peavey. So if anybody don't know, Peavey is that guitar company that makes the amplifiers and all that other cool jazz.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Oh, okay. I seen them.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. And he actually engineered their app where it can talk across the wire, to where he could control a amplifier across the room or so. He was doing it all in Angular, and Angular has this feedback loop, and he couldn't get past the feedback loop. I think it's really called the digest loop. But when it came to React, React updates so quickly that he didn't run into that problem. And he was like, \"Yeah, the way they make these things called life cycle methods, it allows for things just to get done, and you don't got to worry about two way data bindings, or figure out which way the data's coming or which way the data's going. It just all in one uni direction pretty much.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. They gave us the idea of the virtual dom and dipping a virtual dom versus the idea of data binding, which was heavy in Angular One. And I think it feels like most frameworks are kind of doing the virtual dom, even if they present as binding, because View in particular, which is kind of the spiritual successor to Angular One. It's like Angular One, the good parts. It has a virtual [inaudible 00:09:19], but it still gives you that kind of feeling of binding.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Right. He explained it to me, and I was like, \"I kind of get what you're saying, but I don't really get it.\" And this is in 2014, January. So I come on React in its infancy days, and he was like, \"Think of a functional [inaudible 00:09:39] machine from micro processors class that we had.\" And I was like, \"Oh this makes complete sense.\" And that's when the light bulb gone off and I was like, \"Okay, I enjoy this now.\" So yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. That's pretty cool when you can let ... Well, one to have a friend that that has been with you and can present that metaphor to you like that. That's pretty awesome. You go by @Thugdebugger on Twitter, and I've noticed a pattern and debugging is something that you are personally passionate about. Is that a fact?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah, man.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So debugging's something that you enjoy personally, that's your skill set. You identify as a debugger.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So I only use Console Log to debug, and I was wondering how can I improve? I've been doing this a long time, I've had success as a developer, and I literally use Console Log every time. What am I missing out on? What should I do? How can I improve and grow as a developer? I'm old dude set in my ways, but I want to change and get better. What should I be doing? How can I improve that?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So the reason why I'm such a big advocate Authority debugger over the Console is because I feel like by time the Console prints, out you probably missed some critical data, or you probably missed some transition that you wouldn't have caught. I feel like when you use the debugger, that invokes a curiosity. It allows you to go into places that you wouldn't have even thought about. It also gives you a sneak peek of what's going on underneath the hood. I guarantee you if you ask people, \"Have you ever opened up React and actually checked out how it does its thing? Have you actually stepped through a life cycle method trying to figure out what's going on? And 80% or even 90% of people are going to be like, \"No, I really haven't ever thought about that.\"\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     But when you're using the debugger, you get the opportunity. And people are going to argue like, \"Well you could just go into the node module and check it out if you actually care that much,\" but where do you even know where to begin? When you use the debugger and you put these breakpoints in, it's going to guide you down a path, and you could start to really speak the framework ordeal language of what's going on. Like, \"Oh, here's why this is not working. Here's how the engine [inaudible 00:12:00] it to actually work. Here is what I'm trying to do,\" versus getting mad with your Console Log, and you're only seeing a tiny bit of data.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. I also use the debugger statement. So I will drop into the debugger, but then I'm doing it kind of ... I'm not using breakpoints and that kind of thing. And I know, I've seen modern development tools and they're amazing, and I wonder often if it's like you start at a certain point in kind of technology history, right? And you know, console log is what was there, but now we have this robust tool, but I don't touch those tools. And I'm wondering what's the kind of entry level when you get into that? Which browser do you think is the strongest right now in terms of debugging and tooling in that regard?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     When people ask me how to use it, I always say start in a visual studio if you can, but typically, a visual studio code has a pretty good debugging setup.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Okay.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Where you can easily drop in break points on that particular line that you're trying to target. And then when the code executes, you could actually go in to that code in a environment that you feel comfortable with at that time. Versus trying to figure out how to do it in Chrome. I've seen people get confused when I try to explain to them in Chrome. You take the exact same experience and you put it in visual studio code people are like, \"This is much easier. I actually grasp this on what's going on.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, that's pretty cool. And honestly, I've never done that. So I've done it in Chrome, I've done it in Firefox and Safari, those tools. But I've never even dropped into a debugging session and VS code.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. And then the cool thing about VS code is they have that live share option now. So I could make a breakpoint on my end and not say, \"Damn it. I don't know what's going on. I need some help.\" And then I can say, \"Hey, Joel, can you chime in?\" And then you could actually watch that happen live.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. Get a live mutual debugging session going.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Right. And now you're like, \"Okay, we could actually inspect and actually see what's going on more thoroughly,\" versus with the console, you're going to catch some data, but you won't catch every single detail. And sometimes that's what it takes. Today, I was doing C Sharp. I haven't done C Sharp in God knows how long. So my team were like, \"Hey, we need you to do this.\" I'm like, \"Okay cool, I'll do it.\" And I began on the web app, where I just inspected a couple of elements, and I was like, \"Okay, here's what's happening from a JavaScript point of view. I need to figure out, after JavaScript passes it off, what happens on the C Sharp side.\" And I just honestly started dropping breakpoints, and walking down the code, line after line pretty much.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. And then you figure it out, and you get there quicker than you would. Obviously, I think quicker than you would if you were just trying to piece meal put log statements around and figure out what's going on. At that point, you're in the code, and you're able to to get a better vantage of the whole process.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Right. And it goes back to ... I have two senior engineers at my job that used to be on my team, and I used to not be a really big advocate for the debugger. But then they were like, \"Think about your feedback loop. Think about how much time you are taking to actually write the console log, get back on the page, execute that again.\" I'm like, \"Okay, yeah. That's very true.\" Versus going to the code, dropping the breakpoint, and then you hit the same breakpoint again, and again, and again. And the cool thing is that if you can catch the error, you could start tweaking it at that time, and then do it again and again.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, I feel like ... Because I used to do Action Script Three, and it was mostly really IDE based, I feel more than JavaScript is. Because the browser wasn't the issue. And I feel like I used debugging tools more then, but JavaScript, when I hopped into this world, was kind of ... Because of the disconnect between my editor and the browser, there's always been some friction there. But I feel like I'm missing out and I need to step that up and check out these VS code tools.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Man, that's crazy. You said Action Script? I haven't heard that name in a long time.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, rest in peace.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     I mean, that's crazy. The other day I was at this meetup, the React ATL meetup, and I was talking to some people, and this guy said, \"Yeah, I'm a Flash dev.\" And I was like, \"What? You're a who dev?\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, still?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Right. And when he had said it, I was like, \"Oh you mean past tense?\" And he was like, \"No, currently.\" And I was like, \"How? Where? Who?\" But then when you dig pretty deep, you could tell that Flash has such a crippling effect on the industry, because it's such a dependency. That there's a whole lot of companies who just couldn't get it completely out of their code base. So now, those are the people making $300,000 every single year.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Maybe I should have stuck with it. No, I'm pretty happy. I'm about to be honest.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. I'm pretty happy too. Because even in college, they taught us COBOL. So I do know COBOL too. And they're-\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         It's like they're trying to make people not like computers is the goal, sometimes I feel like. Who's going to ... COBOL is just like a history class I suppose, but it's still ...\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Most people don't know this. Our school was one of the only couple schools left teaching COBOL, which they don't at this time. The program at MSU taught it because we have two big fields that use COBOL. Banking, and then the other ones is Dillard's, like the clothing manufacturer.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. Dillard's makes all their employees take COBOL training, all their developers. They still have to use it. So yeah, there's industry. There's people out there using it. But I just can't even imagine.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. I mean that was a way of giving us job security, quote unquote was like, \"Hey, if you can't find a job elsewhere, you can always get one with COBOL.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So what are you learning now? What's got you excited in terms of web development and new things that are happening?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     I've been playing with this idea where it's called Dynamic Reducer Allocation.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So what I'm talking about is if you have two components on the screen, and you want to render a brand new component, which is the same incarnation of component A and B, how do you get component C to inherit the same exact actions as component A and B, but dynamically update the store inside of every ducts without causing conflicts for component A and component B?\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         It would almost be like syncing offline state to database state, it sounds like. It kind of reminds me of that in a way.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah, because if you want the same actions ... Well if you fire the same action on component C, technically component A and component B, would be like, \"Oh, well I could talk about that action, or I could respond to that action.\" But if you do it on component C, you're like, \"No, it's only for component C, not for component A and B.\"\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So I've been running into this problem at my job now and I'm like, \"Okay, how can I get past this?\" So I think I found a way, but that's really been the only thing that's keeping me up at night, on the tech side. On the other side of life, I've been reading some books on habits, and how to break habits, and how to improve your memory. And it's pretty cool, so.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, my favorite habit book in the last year or so, I love Power of Habit. It's kind of been out for a while, but there's Atomic Habits by James Clear. It just blew my mind when I listened to it on an audio book, and he narrates it and really good in general. But it's kind of like the successor to Power of Habit, which is kind of the classic habit book. I love reading about that kind of stuff too. Your brain's a muscle, right? How do we exercise it, and grow it, make it stronger?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     That's exactly right.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So what's something you personally think you need to get better at as a web developer? In terms of broader skills, and how you approach your work.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Honestly, not being scared to say I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. That's hard.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. And I'm not scared per se, but I'm scared of not knowing what I don't know.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Being surprised, right? Something jumping out at you?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah, because it's like ... So you'll always have three lanes, I call it. You either know what you do know, or you know what you don't know, or you don't know what you don't know. And I'm like, \"Okay, I could get past the first two.\" But the last category of you don't really know what you don't know is scary all the time.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. It's chaos, right?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. And I'm running into that problem now at my job, where I'm doing C Sharp, where I don't know what I don't know sometimes. And I'm like, \"Okay, how do I ask a question on what I don't know?\" It goes back to using the debugger again. I just drop breakpoints everywhere, and then I try to formulate what's going on. But for the most part it's hard, man, trying to figure it all out.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         I think one of the things that's difficult, too, is also knowing when you should stop and just ask, right? When you should stop and tap somebody on the shoulder and ask. I like to figure things out on my own, but at the same time, when do you just stop doing that, and approach somebody that probably has the answer?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. Because at my job, I don't want to feel like a burden, per se. I have a good team. The team I work on ... So I'm the scrum master of the team, and we're a complete agile engineering force, where we do two week sprints right now. And I don't want to feel like I'm slowing down the team, so sometimes I get scared to ask, because I don't want to impede anybody else progress. But at the same time I'm like, \"Okay, if I do ask, what do I need to ask?\" And that's the hardest thing.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Asking a good question. Right?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Right. Because there is no such thing as a dumb question, but there are such a thing as questions that haven't been thoroughly vetted.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. My favorite resource, Stack Overflow, has an entire Wiki section devoted to asking good questions, and it's one of my favorite resources and I send it to people, just like, \"Hey just check this out, okay?\" Because there's two different ways. There's lots of ways to ask questions, and there's definitely good ways and there's bad ways, and it provides a framework for asking good questions. And it's funny, because in the process of asking a good question, and preparing to ask a good question, you can often answer your own question.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     That's the funny thing, is that I feel like Stack Overflow gets a bad rap because of how you have to ask the question. A lot of people don't know, because they can see the polished side of me now, but I was one question out from being banned off of there. Because I would always ask questions, questions that obviously had answered. And back to my old friend, Chris Butler, he was like, \"Hey, you have to learn how to ask a question.\" And I was like, \"Well, I'm asking a question, people just don't want to answer it.\" He's like, \"No, no, no. You have to learn how to formulate a question that engineers are going to be able to be like, 'Oh, here's your problem.'\"\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     And I would tell people the exact same thing, like, \"Hey, have you checked the board on how to ask a question?\" And the usual response is, \"No, I don't get how come I have to.\" I'm like, \"Well, if you check the board first, then you would figure out how to ask a question so that you'll get the answer that you seek.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. And to me, it's the more I get comfortable with sales, and marketing, and that kind of thing, I think it's almost like a sales and marketing process. And it feels disconnected, but at the same time that's what you're ... You're trying to sell somebody on giving you some of their time to answer your question and-\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     That's very true.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         ... And you're going to want to come back and be able to have the capital with them to ask again. Right? You want to be somebody that they're enthusiastic about helping, so you have to do your part to get to that point.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Right. Right.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         So Atlanta ... I don't think people necessarily think of Atlanta and think of a tech hub, but it is in fact a metropolis, and there's a lot of tech going on, and you are bringing a conference to Atlanta next summer. And can you tell us about what you're doing, and what your conference is?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Man. So this is the part I get happy about, because-\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Nice.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     ... People are always like, \"Why ATL? You could've did it in Cali, you could of did it in Texas. Why ATL? I mean, even do it up North,\" and I'm like, \"If you come visit ATL, and you just hang out downtown for a couple of days, you could see the culture changing.\" You could see how enriched the culture already is, but you could see it moving in a more progressive manner to where I feel like Atlanta is the next ... I don't want to say Silicon Valley, but the next major tech hub.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     But the cool thing is, I feel like it's going to be a NYC situation, where all the crossroads, or all the people of the of world are going to gather here. So I'm trying to get ahead of the curve, and I can already see it coming.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         The conference is Render Atlanta, right?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Uh-huh (affirmative).\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         And what are the goals of your conference?\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So the goals, honestly man, it's kind of personal, but at the same time it's about representing for ATL.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So I got tired of traveling, and going places to just go see a decent talk, or just to go hang out with other React engineers, because I do know that they're here, but we're so scattered. And people would always say stuff to me and like, \"Hey what's going on in ATL? Why isn't there anything going on there? I don't think ATL has all that great of engineers.\"\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     People will say stuff like this to me. And I will be like, \"No, you all just have never came. You're just judging a book by past history of it's in the South, so what can they have?\"\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     So I was like \"Okay, I'm going to go on this mission to bring awareness to what's going on in ATL,\" because like I said, we have great engineers, they're just in so many different neighborhoods of ATL. Because you got a lot of neighborhoods. You got Midtown, you got Buckhead, Five Points, I mean you have all over ATL.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, it's spread out.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah, but I'm trying to bring everybody together. At the same time I was like, \"Well this is what I consider the cultural melting pot of the South,\" and there never has been a major React focus conference here. Of course, we got Connect Tech but that's like a conglomerate of 20 other things going on.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     I was like, \"I want something that's going to bring awareness to ATL, that's going to show off the culture, that's also going to advocate for people that are under-represented in technology, because ATL has a huge population of minorities.\" So then, okay, I definitely want to include that too, but I want the best speakers possible. And just to give a shout out to my boy, Ken Wheeler, he was the one that honestly pushed me. Because he was like, \"Hey, why don't you do something in ATL? I mean I get that you know people, so you should probably leverage that.\" And I was like, \"That sounds expensive as hell, you know.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         And like a lot of work too. Expensive and a lot of work.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Right. But I'm not afraid of the work part, because I used to do a video game tournaments.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Oh okay, cool. You've done this before.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Yeah. So I have a event planning background, and I did do Smash tournaments and [inaudible 00:28:49] tournament, so I get the whole planning side of it.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. The logistics, you got that covered.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Right. But the whole .... It's much easier to keep Smash players fed, because you give them cookies and pizza.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Doritos.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Right, it's much easier. Engineers are like doctors, they want a world class service.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         They want cuisine.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     ... And even if they don't want that, I don't want them to feel like they're coming to some conference that, \"Okay, they skipped on everything else, but we got good talks.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah. You want to put on a good show, right? You want the whole thing to be an experience for people, and really showcase what Atlanta has to offer, and what's going on in the ATL.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     Exactly. Because ATL man, give them an additional five more years, and it's going to be crazy. It's going to be a boom. I mean, they were in the top of five for the new Amazon office. So I mean, they have the potential. We have a tiny bit more work to do, but I think ATL is on the right path. And I'm even a member at this private club called The Gathering Spot, where it's a place for like-minded entrepreneurs to come gather.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     And every time I go in there, I'm always running into somebody of prominence that I can talk to, and I'm like, \"Hey, here's what I'm trying to do, can you help me?\" And it's always a yes, because I want to help ATL be this beaming icon of progress.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     That was the goal, man, was to have a world class conference with the best speakers, which if you ask me, I could tell you now, because by the time this comes out, we'll have dropped it, and with the best atmosphere possible, and go above and beyond so that people could know what they should expect from every other conference.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     And at the same time hammer home, \"Hey, this is ATL. We are a progressive city filled with some of the best engineers that you know, a majority are from under represented groups. Come here, help us, hire us, and we could do great things.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**         Yeah, that's awesome Justin. And I think the work you're doing with Render ATL, and I'm just looking forward to this conference quite a bit and seeing what you get up to even after that. And I really appreciate you taking the time out of your day to come chat with me. It's been great. Thank you very much.\n\n**Justin Samuels:**     No problem bro, no problem.",

The manager has an obligation to their team. The decisions of managers make a tremendous impact on folk's lives. \n\nBut managers are only human. \n\n\"When we go into school there's kind of this sense that authorities are these all-knowing kind of perfect figures that are responsible for everything.\" The reality is that managers are humans that are dealing with their circumstances. It's easy to put all of the responsibility on them, but they need to be seen as people.\n\nPeople fail. Managers aren't the only people burdened with responsibility. There's the \"10x Engineer\" or \"The Hero Programmer,\" that end up with severe burnout.   \n\nManaging is an ethical and moral profession. Managers have to make ethical decisions in regards to deciding who gets promoted, fired, given a raise. How do we get justice and results? That's what makes management an elegant puzzle. \n\n---\n\n### Episode Quotes\n> \"At companies that are struggling there is a lot of opportunity. And sometimes it's not easy opportunity, and it's not structured super well it's not packaged up, or you just get to have an easy entry into management.\"\n\n> \"There's not someone teaching you there's not an easy path. You just have to go learn by trying, thinking, um going back to the principles and trying to figure out how to make it all come together.\"\n\n> \"When we go into school there's kind of this sense that authorities are these all-knowing kind of perfect figures that are responsible for everything.\"\n\n> \"Really any fast-growing company is the best place in the world to learn quickly about systems and how they work in reality.\"\n\n> \"if you get good at the cold email of asking one short, crisp question that's a good question you can meet anyone.\"\n\n### Resources\n- [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186)\n- [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557)\n- [Greenhouse.io](http://www.greenhouse.io/)\n\n### Will Larson\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Lethain?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://lethain.com)\n\n### Joel Hooks\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Marisa Morby is a professional product manager. A common question she gets is \"what's the difference between a product manager and a project manager?\" There's a lot of overlap, but the difference is a product manager has to understand what needs to get done and why and be able to communicate that, and the project manager makes sure that everything stays on the rails and results in a cohesive product. \n\nMany teams put significant of focus on user outcomes. A user outcome is the ultimate goal of the user. It's what they need to happen. If we don't know what the user needs to happen, we'll end up focusing on the wrong thing. \n\nTo figure out what a user wants user research needs to get conducted. No, you don't have to break out the lab coat. Research doesn't have to be so rigid. Just have conversations with your users and try to gain an understanding of their wants, needs, and frustrations. Make sure that you don't make assumptions about your user's needs. Ask questions that might seem painfully obvious to you\n\nMarisa also talks about working with all-remote team. We live in an amazing day and age that allows us to do our work wherever we want, but there are challenges we have to overcome for everyone to still be productive. We have lizard brains that make it challenging to build trust with people whose faces we never see. Regular video meetings that give some space for non-work conversations are essential in building that trust with people. Meeting people in person also has a substantial positive impact on communication; it gives you a lot of context with people's mannerisms!\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n- [Just Enough Research](https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research)\n\n### Marisa Morby\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marisamorby?lang=en)\n- [Website](https://marisamorby.com/)\n\n### Joel Hooks\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

Your clients will have their own needs and constraints that you're going to have to adapt to serve your client well. \n\nThe constant learning can feel like a freefall. Constantly feeling dumb is panic-inducing. There's this trough of despair in software, where you swing between feeling like a genius and then going right back to despair. \n\nWe can't just learn, but we have to learn well. It's critical to retain what you learned. Keep a developer journal, start a blog for yourself, discuss what you learned in a study group, etc. The less you have to relearn things, the less time you'll be spending in the trough of despair. \n\nThe dreaded technical interview tends to have the problem of not testing you on anything that you should be learning. You have to spend your time cramming and hoping that the interviewer gives you problems that are still fresh in your mind. A one size fits all solution doesn't work and doesn't end up being objective. Candidates should get the opportunity to show off their skill and what they already know instead of figuring out what they don't know. \n\n---\n\n### Laurie Barth\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laurieontech?lang=en)\n- [Website](https://laurieontech.com)\n\n### Joel Hooks\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "transcript": "**Joel Hooks:**               Hi, Veni.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Hi, Joel. How are you?\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I'm doing great. How are you doing?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Good. Thank you.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I have several things I'm excited to talk to you about. One, you started a business in the last year, and I really want to get into that and what it's about. But, first, I wanted to kind of talk about technology and being a software developer, and, specifically, you've got a master's and a bachelor's degree in computer science.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               You have that education, and I was wondering, how does that education prepare you for your career in software development development?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               I studied computer science in 1991 to 2003. So, at that time, it didn't quite prepare me for a career in software development.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               There wasn't really an Internet, even. I mean, so it's all changed radically since then, I would think.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah. Yes. Yes, it did. Yeah. So I studied computer science, and it was a great experience, but it was a little bit tough for someone like me, who was new to coding. It seemed like a lot of my classmates, everybody already knew how to code, and I kind of felt a little bit behind.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               But, even though it was difficult, I got through it, and, as I was approaching graduation, I learned that the real world software development wasn't exactly what I learned in computer science, in my classes.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               They hold that back until you're actually about to graduate, and they're like, \"Actually, the real world might be different than what we've been doing.\"\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes, yes. So towards my junior year is kind of when I realized that, so I started volunteering for side projects and nonprofits to gain some real world experience, and, also, that's when I realized that there's also an IT-focused business degree. I was like, \"Oh, shoot, that's probably what I should've studied.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Right.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               But I then took some classes there, too, that really helped. But, yeah, in computer science, often there's a lot of misconceptions about what it is. It doesn't quite prepare you for software development. It's more like a lot of theory.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So how would you describe computer science, then? Because I agree. I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what computer science is vs. the engineering side, perhaps, if you wanted to compare the two. But what is computer science?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Computer science, I feel like it's the study of what is a computer. Things we learned was like how do you build a compiler from scratch or a parser from scratch or a database from scratch, which is all useful to learn, like what computers do. But in the real world, we're using computers to build software. So it's not there in computer science, when you're studying it.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah. Have you built a compiler since ... After you graduated, have you ever sat down to build a compiler?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               No.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I think it's interesting, though, because there's a lot of current technology, like in the web development space, like Babel and other things like that, where people are really getting down there to the compiler level, and that knowledge is useful.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I know a bunch of people that don't have that formal education background are now kind of not necessarily scrambling, but trying to learn that theory and understand, \"How do I build a compiler, parse an AST, or do that sort of thing?\", which is interesting, as well. So it can and is useful, for sure.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes, yes.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               But my personal practice, I'm mostly what I call a glue coder. I take all the really smart ideas that other people do and then just assemble them into something that works for users.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah. I'm the same way.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I think there's a convergence, whether you go to school, whether you don't. If you want to be employed, there's only so many research spots available in the world, so the rest of us are just kind of building things ...\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               ... to facilitate commerce and whatnot.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yep.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               You said it was a little rocky, because you came into it not understanding how to code, and I had the same experience. I think it's hard. I was wondering, when you first encountered it, how did you overcome the process of just the general weirdness of being introduced to computer code?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               For me, it was, I think, one of the hard things, going through college, was that it sort of becomes a competition, and I felt like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm behind. I need to catch up.\" But I think, after a while, I decided to let go of that mentality and just focus on, \"Doesn't matter what grades are. I'm just going to learn to learn and understand.\"\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               I think that really helped a lot. It kind of became like a puzzle I was trying to solve - or like things I wanted to build, once I started focusing on that, it became a little easier for me.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I'm reading a great book right now called Mindset that talks specifically about that. It's the growth vs. fixed, where if it's a game or if it's a contest, then you're competing against other people, and that's a fixed mindset.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               But if you consider this just a challenge for yourself and something that you want to learn, that's a growth mindset, and it's statistically, scientifically proven that that mindset leads to more success, especially in hard situations like that, like in an academic environment. People that see it as a contest, \"Nope. I'm going to lose,\" and then they just quit ...\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yep.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               ... vs. the other way, which I think that's probably true professionally, too, honestly. That's just a way to look at life.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah, yeah. I definitely agree. Yeah, I didn't think about it that way, but that really changed how I view things now. It's definitely not a competition. It's just my personal goals and meeting the requirements of the users. Once you prioritize that, it kind of becomes easier.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, and I love the puzzle aspect. I think that's probably my single favorite thing about this career, is that if you treat it as such, it's a constant, interesting puzzle that you get to solve on a daily basis. That part of it is super fulfilling for me, anyway.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah, same for me, too. Every new framework, everything is kind of like, \"Oh, how do figure this out? How do I make this work?\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, I've seen a lot ... People talk about fatigue, but, at the same time, it's really actually kind of fun.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah, yeah. It is fun.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So what are your favorite software tools? What are you using now? What's your favorite stack?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Right now, I'm a big fan of Netlify. I recently used it to launch a number of projects, and it's been great. It lets you do web posting, but also lets you build and deploy your projects pretty fast and also lets you set up your HTTPS automatically. Everything just works.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, it's great. I love it.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah, and I'm in the process of moving a lot of my projects onto it. So it's one of my favorites right now. Also, Gatsby has been awesome. It's a static site generator, and I don't even know React, but I was able to build a pretty good website just readily.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So there's a Create React app, which is the kind of official tool for scaffolding up your React app, and Gatsby has replaced that for me in general. The approach, the static rendering and the GraphQLs is really, really neat.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               You've been doing this for a while. You said you graduated in 2003. What's changed? What's the big differences or the big shifts in kind of how we approach these problems? What changed over that time, since you've been doing this?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               When I was starting out, there was never a focus on user experience. That's a big thing that has changed, which I'm very glad for. I think we never thought about, \"How does the user use this? How do we make their life better?\" It was always \"build something and teach them how to use it.\"\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               That was kind of the mentality for most of my workplaces, and I'm really glad that kind of mentality is changing and we're working more on user experience and how to make it better for the user. So that's been a big change, from what I've seen.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               In terms of the puzzle aspect of this job, what's your favorite sort of software challenge? What gets you excited when you get to sit down and solve a problem?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               For me, it's ... I think the newness really excites me. I know I can't always work on new things. That's why I have a lot of side projects. I think there are so many different frameworks. There are so many different tools. But everyone has their reasons for starting, getting everything suitable for certain things.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               So it's kind of very interesting how this creator has figured out that this is a good way to go about it for this problem and so on, and for me to learn it and figure out which framework is best for this project vs. another one. So I think just learning the new thing and trying to apply it for the right problem, I think that that excites me a lot.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, it's interesting, too, when you combine the picking tools with the idea of user experience. I think that ... because that's part of it, at the end of the day. UX isn't just the visual design, obviously, but it's also the tools that we use and our ability to address concerns and create features, too.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               What are you working on right now?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Currently, I'm working on Diversify Tech. It is a project that kind of came out of my own need. It's where I'm sharing resources, like jobs, events, and opportunities for underrepresented people in tech, because, a lot of times, there are opportunities out there, but they're shared in closed networks, and sometimes, when you're new to tech or when you're one of the few people in tech, you're just not aware.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               So one of the goals with Diversify Tech is to kind of bring awareness to opportunities for underrepresented people.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               With Diversify Tech, how are you bringing awareness? What are the tools that you're using? I don't necessarily mean software tools, either. Sorry. I mean, what's your approach, in terms of bringing awareness?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah. So I've sort of been unconsciously building a community. At previous Diversify Tech, I started a newsletter called Code with Veni, which was to help women get into tech, and I've sort of been building a community. With that community, I kind of figured out some of the things that people need.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               So using that community to start out with, I'm expanding that community more and connecting with other networks, other communities, and kind of bringing awareness in that way.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               There's also ... There's kind of a job placement or kind of matchmaking service for employers and potential candidates, too.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes, yes. One of the things I've noticed is that a lot of companies are working on diversity and inclusion in their workplaces, but some of the newer companies, they're not quite sure how to get started, or they're not aware that a job description can make a difference in who applies to your job, or if you target only computer science universities that you might not be aware of other candidates that would be interested. So things like that, I'm trying to help out employers to ...\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So it's almost like a consulting aspect to the business.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, that's interesting. I'm a big believer that most people want to do the right thing, and when you hear, \"Oh, we need an inclusive and diverse company,\" I think most people would want that, at the end of the day. But how do they get there and do it in a way that makes sense and actually works and fits the bill? That's probably a hard question for people to solve.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes, yes.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So you launched Diversify Tech in 30 days. I watched a Twitter thread that you created. You're going through, and you actually built the business from the software and the ability to be a business in a 30-day challenge. I was wondering what that process was like for you, what you learned from that experience.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Initially, the idea for Diversify Tech, I came up with it last year sometime and actually was like ... Over a weekend, I built something very minimal, and I put it out there to see if people were interested. I got a lot of positive reception from it, and it was great.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               But I have a job. I have a baby. With that, I just did not have the time to work on it more, and then I'm part of a community called Women Make. In October, I think they wanted to do this 30-day challenge, where each of us, our own personal project or work project or business, take that project and launch it in 30 days.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               It was an amazing experience, because I think it really made me focus, figure out a plan for it, what am I going to include, and how am I going to do this. It was great to also have the support of the community, because all of us were working on a variety of different things. One of my friends was writing a book. Another person was working on their blog.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               It was all way different, but we all had this main goal to put something out there, and we also asked each other for feedback and incorporated it. It was just awesome to have that support. Actually, at the end of it, we also, all of us launched on Product Hunt, and if it wasn't for the community, I probably would not have thought about doing that.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               So, because I launched, I actually got number two most promoted product of the day, and I also got a Golden Kitty Award.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Oh, nice. That's awesome.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah, and, honestly, I wouldn't have thought about it if it wasn't for this community, that I should do this.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So, after that's done, is that ... I mean, launching is so difficult, I think. Ideas are easy, they say, but the actual execution is the challenge. Since then, since you did that challenge, have you been keeping it up, and is it something that you continue to work on?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes, definitely. I've been trying to grow the community more, and, also, finally, I've been trying to start a business for a very long time. But this is my first business where I have actual customers and that's finally generating revenue. So it's been great that way. So I'm trying to connect with more employers to help them with their diversity initiatives and trying to get more people hired.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               I mean, diversity can be approached in so many different ways. Right now, I'm trying to figure out what the best way is. I'm trying different ways, and we'll see how it goes. But, so far, it's going well.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               What does it mean to ... When somebody says that people need to do the work for diversity, what does that mean?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               First, kind of realizing that we all have biases and, after acknowledging that, kind of trying to figure out that maybe we can do something about it, and you know something? It doesn't have to be this major thing, but taking small steps.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               For example, somebody I follow on Twitter, Tatiana Mac, she said that, \"Okay, here are some simple ways that you an include gender pronouns\" - for example, included in your Slack profile or your email signature and things like that. It's way simple. I just took ten minutes to make all of those changes.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               So I think first is being aware that we have a problem and then working towards some of the inequalities that exist in tech.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, and it's kind of ... I feel like representation and just visibility has been a big and important factor. I mean, does that make a difference, if we see more people doing this thing, and young people see it and get the aspiration? I feel like that's kind of part of the overall puzzle.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes, yes, definitely, and one of the things I'm ... I have a newsletter called Code with Veni, and that's kind of the main theme behind it, is to show women that there are people like them out there so that it encourages them to think that they can do it, too - and they can. Even for me, it has helped a lot to see other women that are speaking or things like that. It really helps me, also, too.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Sure, because you're organizing it, but I imagine you're learning and growing through the entire process and meeting people and benefit from the community as well, right?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes, yes. Definitely. For example, I've been invited to podcasts before, but I've never said yes ...\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Oh, wow. Thank you.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               ... because I was like, \"People like me don't do these kind of things.\" For speaking, for the longest time, I never did anything, because I just never saw people like me do it. I was like ... It really helped, for example, Lindsey and Ali, who have been on your podcast, who are like, \"Oh, we've been on Joel's podcast, and it was an amazing experience.\" I was like, \"Oh, people like me can do this.\"\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Oh, that's great to hear.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah, yeah. So, definitely, representation matters, like seeing people like me kind of doing more than the stereotypes, it really helps a lot.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah. I agree with that, and doing the work, for me, has been really considering that. I graduated high school in the early '90s, and it just wasn't even a topic. I love that, kind of almost as a society, we're kind of growing past that, and we have a long ways to go, but it's good to me.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I think everybody deserves the opportunity to enjoy these lucrative careers and remote work and kind of having it be puzzles every day to solve. I think it's rewarding and want everybody to experience it that wants to.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes, definitely.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So I'm really curious about just building the business, and you mentioned, when you were graduating, you found out there was an IT for business degree that you could've taken. But you didn't, right? You don't have a business degree, and you ...\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               No.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               ... have had a goal to start a business. What's that been like? As opposed to being a software engineer, what's the business side of it like, and how have you approached that, or how do you think about that? Maybe what did you learn in the process?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               So, yeah, I do not have a business background, and it's been an experience to kind of learn a lot of things on my own. Marketing has been a big weakness for me, so ...\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, I feel that one.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               I know. I actually discovered the MegaMaker community through a book called Marketing for Developers.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So that's Justin Jackson's ...\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               That's his community, right?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes, yes, and it's ... Things like that, I found different communities to kind of help me with my business. I am also part of a group called Dreamers and Doers, which is for women entrepreneurs, and we do a lot of exchange of information, like I give tech help and they teach me how to do social media marketing, things like that.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               So it's been a process. It's not something I learned overnight. It's been the past three years, I've been picking up things here and there, like marketing or copywriting, which I'm still trying to figure out.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               That feels like a lifelong pursuit. One thing I'm always amazed at, I think there's a lot of crossover, in terms of the puzzle aspects of business and software ...\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yep.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               ... because it's fun and interesting. You have to figure it out, and there's so many facets to it.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes. Yeah, I think sometimes it helps to kind of look at the data behind it for me, because, for social media strategy, what's working, what's not working, kind of to see the data behind it, it's like a puzzle that I'm trying to figure out - What is working? What's not? Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So my personal favorite ... I don't know if you're familiar with Copyhackers and their materials, but Joanna Wiebe puts out amazing work, and it's one of my favorite places for learning the hard tech, writing persuasive copy, which is interesting, because once you do this, once you spend several years trying to get better in this space, it affects everything.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               It kind of affects your communication overall, and I feel like I'm always pitching. For better or worse, whenever I'm writing, like I'll be writing a text message, and I'm like, \"I'm pitching again.\" It just kind of seeps into your soul, and I think it's like writing software. It kind of does the same thing.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah, yeah. That's [inaudible 00:18:38].\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So you've been writing a newsletter, Code with Veni, and I was wondering, why did you choose that format over kind of maybe a more traditional blog format?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Code with Veni started ... Actually, before Code with Veni, I used to do online answers for people, kind of like one-on-one mentoring for people who needed it, and I started seeing that people had the same questions again and again. It was either about salary negotiation or \"What is the first thing that I do if I want to get into tech?\" or \"Which programming language should I start with?\"\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               It was a lot of common questions, so I was like, \"One-on-one answers is not sustainable and scalable, so let me see if I can reach out to more people and share this knowledge with more folks.\"\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               So that's why I started the newsletter, and then, also, I realized that, again, because of lack of diversity in tech, I noticed that a lot of bloggers who are women are not highlighted as much. So I started focusing on that, too. There are a lot of women bloggers, but you just don't see them a lot, so I started focusing on them and amplifying their work.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               So it's kind of like ... I think I'm trying to do both share information, but also amplify other people who are already doing the work. So that's why I chose the newsletter format instead of just blogging.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               For me, it's almost more personal, like the style of writing, and it doesn't necessarily have to be. I just kind of feel like I fall into a different mode when I'm writing ...\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               ... an email vs. writing a blog post. I agree. I wish I did both more. I feel like I always need to be blogging or writing or doing something, like that constant drive to just do something.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah. I mean, that's another reason. Blogging is a lot more time-consuming, too.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah. It's more formal, I think. It's out there, right? It exists in the world, so you have to polish it more and that sort of thing.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               So community seems to be a recurring theme in the discussion and what you're doing. It's like this idea of building communities, and you mentioned a couple business-related MegaMakers and Dreamers and Doers. I was wondering what other communities you generally recommend to people that are aspiring software developers or software developers?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               I mean, dev.to is one of my favorite software development communities right now.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, they're great.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               It's a very supportive community. People are receptive. People are more collaborative, and they give you constructive feedback instead of just critique, things like that. So dev.to is one of my favorites, and I think I mentioned Women Make is another great community for women who are making products. It's a very \"go, go, go\" kind of community, which really helps to help with your motivation.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               I also love Indie Hackers, which seems to be a lot of software developers plus solopreneurs kind of group.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I noticed Rosie Sherry being kind of their community liaison over there, and it was a great community before, but now they have a person that's actively in there, tunneling I think is the word, which is a weird word. I had to look it up, but it's the idea of getting in there and getting the community to do things and stuff.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I love what they're doing at Indie Hackers. It's such a neat thing, because Stripe bought them, but then they fund them, and they don't really expect anything. There's no commercial goal, or they're not trying to profit or squeeze ROI out of it. It's like they're just very well-funded and now can grow this community organically, and I think that's awesome.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah, yeah. I love that community. I especially love the stories that founders share, because I think, a lot of times, we don't get the full story, but with Indie Hackers, I like that they share what kind of marketing did they do to get this to work. Things like that are very useful when you're working on similar products.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, it's kind of in the trenches, and I love the crossover. It feels to me like ... I don't know. I don't want to say hacker news, because people have a really negative opinion on that, but maybe how it was back when it first started, but without the goal of ...\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I don't know, because it's about Indie Hackers, right? It's about bootstrapping businesses. It's not about venture capital, which is different and unusual, I think, in the space of building business, and my preferred. That's what I love. I love that world. It generally fosters better communities.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I think dev.to is one of the best, my current favorite in terms of software development. I absolutely love what Ben and them have been doing with that, and I think it can be a little overwhelming, too. So how do you recommend people get started on dev.to?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               dev.to, I think you can either be just a reader, if you want, and just learn from others. I see some folks kind of asking questions or kind of bringing up topics that they want to talk about. So that seems like an easy way to get started, and I see a lot of people getting started with blogging because of dev.to.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               They try out a topic. It may not be a huge blog post. They start off with a small topic, and, as they get feedback, they write more and more. So I've been noticing that a lot, too, I think because the community's supportive. It makes it easier. You don't have to be afraid that people are going to critique you.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, because they just don't really tolerate any sort of ... You can't attack people.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               You can't be super negative. If you're not going to do that, then you just don't belong here.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               No.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               You can go to Reddit or wherever, where that sort of thing is allowed.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah, they moderate really well, so that helps a lot.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               I generally recommend that folks start their own space, but, at the same time, if somebody hasn't blogged at all, if you haven't written anything and published it in the public, I think it's just such an amazing spot. I know several people that have used that as their first spot to go blog and actually do the thing, which is amazing. There needs to be more space like that, where people can feel safe to express themselves.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Speaking of ... What do you think, in terms of individuals? Each of us is an individual, and how do we contribute or help create better online communities?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               I think it helps to be a good listener, too, instead of ... Participating in a community is listening to our fellow developers or so on, see how we can help them. It seems like a weird thing to suggest, but being nice and respectful of people and their opinions, accepting that we're not always right about everything, but we should think about others' opinions and see how we can learn from them. I think that kind of attitude helps.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               I think being open to people who are different, who have different opinions. I think having that kind of attitude helps a lot. In all of the communities that I've mentioned so far, like MegaMakers and Women Make and dev.to, I think the common theme they have is they're all really supportive. A lot of the times, in these communities, I may not be the ... I may be the minority in the group, but I still very accepted.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Yeah, so ... Well, I would say that, I mean, the word might be inclusive, right?\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yes.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               We're listening, and I think it's actually ... It's a learned skill. We may be born with it early, though I have a young child, about the same age as yours, and they're little tyrants, a lot of the time. So I feel like that sort of thing is learned over time, like accepting others, and it's something you can work on. It's an actual skill that you can build.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Well, Veni, I really appreciate you taking the time out of your day to talk to me. I'm glad you've done your first podcast. I hope you consider doing more, because you're awesome, and I think you have a lot to share. Thank you so much for hanging out.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. It's been a great experience. Thank you.\n\n**Joel Hooks:**               Good to hear. Bye-bye.\n\n**Veni Kunche:**               Bye.",

    "description": "There are a few options for those trying to start a career in web development, teach yourself, join a bootcamp, or go to college. Veni chose the college route, she got a master's degree in computer science, which is awesome, but it didn't fully prepare her for web development. Computer science is primarily theory and it doesn't really prepare you for the engineering side of the job. There are only so many research positions where you'll get to applying your degree directly, the vast majority of us are facilitating commerce. \n\nWhen Veni was earning her degree the competition between her peers was fierce, but in order to grow she had to let go of that competition mentality. It becomes a puzzle for you to solve instead a competition between others. Having this kind of growth mindset is key to unlocking your learning potential. \n\nYou hear about JavaScript fatigue everywhere and all the time. It's exhausting to try to keep up with the Joneses. Let go of the competition and do this for yourself. Each new technology is an interesting puzzle for you to solve. \n\nVeni is currently working towards increasing the diversity in the tech industry. She's building a community, figuring out what people need, and building awareness of opportunities. A lot of companies are trying to improve their diversity, but a lot of them aren't aware of how to do it in the best away. \n\nTo work for diversity we need to realize that we all have biases, and figure out how to do something about them. We also need to understand that visibility and representation has a considerable impact. When you're a white male you get role models everywhere you look, people to look up to and help you realize that you too can get where they are. Underrepresented people don't have role models everywhere you look in every field you could possibly want to be in. \n\n---\n\n### Resources\n- [Diversify Tech](https://www.diversifytech.co/)\n\n### Veni Kunche\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/venikunche?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [codewithveni.com](http://www.codewithveni.com/)\n- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/venikunche)\n- [Diversify Tech](https://www.diversifytech.co/)\n\n### Joel Hooks\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "You don't have to be passionate about code to have a successful career as a developer. Pariss Athena talks about how it isn't the code itself that motivates her to get better at understanding it. It's what being good at code provides that drives her.\n\nThe financial freedom code gives Athena enables her to give more to the people and communities that are important to her. Success to her is freedom and helping others find success too. She is working on the Black Tech Pipeline, a platform to bring resources and exposure to the black tech community. \n\nWhat can those of us who are already established in this industry do to help underrepresented people? Athena says speak up, reach out to the community with opportunities for jobs, speaking engagements, podcasts, etc. Diversity doesn't just happen by default. Systemically we don't have a society that enables that. We have to be active and be a part of the team to make it happen.  \n\n---\n\n### Resources\n- [#BlackTechPipeline](https://blacktechpipeline.substack.com/welcome)\n\n### Pariss Athena\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/parissathena?lang=en)\n\n### Joel Hooks\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Vue has a reputation of being the most beginner-friendly framework, but that didn't just happen by accident. The Vue CLI is an excellent example. New developers often struggle with using the terminal and remembering all the commands. The Vue CLI provides a visual interface for the developer to generate a project. By making it easier for newcomers to make Vue projects, they've reduced the barriers to entry. Beginner-friendly doesn't mean basic. Many large-scale projects use Vue. \n\nAnother example of something that fosters beginners and benefits established developers is how friendly, and inclusive the Vue community is. Natalia Tepluhina talks about gender mismatch in JavaScript and how the Vue Vixens are making efforts to make the gender ratio evener. \n\nThe Vue Vixens are using free and accessible education as the primary means of getting more women into tech. Natalia Tepluhina goes on to share her two main ideas when it comes to designing a good workshop. Stay accessible to people of all skill levels; don't assume what people know. Stick to one stack and one concept. People have a finite amount of mental resources; trying to do too much can end up just overwhelming people. \n\n---\n\n### Resources\n- [Vue Vixens](https://vuevixens.org/)\n- [Cognitive Load Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Explorations-Instructional-Performance-Technologies/dp/144198125X/ref=sr_1_2?crid=69U55EJB4LGI&keywords=cognitive+load+theory&qid=1563586184&s=books&sprefix=cognitive+load+%2Cstripbooks%2C193&sr=1-2)\n\n### Natalia Tepluhina\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/n_tepluhina?lang=en)\n- [Github](https://github.com/NataliaTepluhina/)\n- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/n_tepluhina)\n\n### Joel Hooks\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

J.C. put it together, publically by using Github issues, blogging, and posting about it on Twitter. The community responds well when you are genuine and trying to do something good, and bringing them in and giving them a sense of ownership is what J.C. attributes as the single most significant contributor to the conference's success. \n\nIf you have the opportunity to do something like this for your city, go for it.

    "description": "What do we do when all of our needs are met when we are making seventy-five thousand plus a year, working for a company with some prestige, have a home, and don't have to worry about food. Jason Lengstorf wrestled with this after the company he was contracting with didn't have anything for him to do, but kept him around. New goals have to be set, and growth still has to happen. \n\nJason discovered that what he wanted was to help other people grow in their personal and professional lives. To help other people you have to have a set of skills beyond your technical skills, typically these skills would be called \"soft skills,\" but they are often just as important as technical skills, Jason prefers to call these skills \"meta\" or \"catalytic\" skills. These are the skills used in planning, bringing people together, decision making, all of these being essential in our careers. \n\nYou don't just use these kinds of skills in a software project; they are also the tools that are used to build communities of people. Jason explains how the trick to bringing a group of people together with something is to make everyone feel invested in what they are a part of, and like they belong. \n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)\n\n**Jason Lengstorf**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\n- [lengstorf.com](https://lengstorf.com/)\n\n- [Github](https://github.com/jlengstorf)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Teaching provides a learner with more information, but the information isn't the only thing that is required to teach effectively. Doing is almost just as essential as the information itself for the learner to solidify what was taught. Creating an effective learning path is challenging, and we tend to start from what we know and take it from there. Janelle challenges the tendency to start from our knowledge, and instead, we should start from where we want our learners to end up being and work backward from there, this is called *Backward Design*. \n\nBackward design doesn't just apply to education, it applies directly to software development. As developers, it's essential that we get out of our head and start with the user. \n\nHow do you start teaching if you have no one to teach? Janelle says there are three critical components to building your audience, having an email list, providing valuable content, and consistency. If you stay genuine and provide value you'll filter out anyone who doesn't resonate with you and what you offer. \n\n---\n\n**Resources**\n\n- [Badass: Making Users Awesome](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24737268-badass)\n\n- [Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/336248.Shambhala)\n\n**Janelle Allen:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/janelleallen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Jen Looper, developer advocate and the founder of Vue Vixens, didn't study software development in college, she has a Ph.D. in French Literature. Her degree might seem unrelated, but it strengthened her ability to explain complex ideas as well as her overall communication abilities, skills that are essential for her role as a developer advocate. These skills also come into play in her work building the Vue Vixens community, which now has over 20+ chapters all over the world!\n\nThe workshop has been a powerful tool for growing the Vue Vixens. Jen explains how the shared experience of learning, eating, and hanging out together can build a lot of lasting connections. Vue Vixens has also branched out from workshops into also hosting meetups, the structure of which is determined by the local chapter leader to suit the needs of their particular location. \n\nBut what makes a great workshop? Minimal installation, maximum output. Codesandbox and Nativescript playground have massively cut down on the initial setup times for the Vue Vixen workshops by doing away with all of the installing and installation issues that will always come up. Jen likes to use a cute app project to make the workshop more fun and to make exploring the deeper concepts less dry. To Jen, workshops are about empowerment first and foremost. If a student can leave the workshop feeling empowered and hungry to learn they'll end up much better off than if they learned more but left feeling disinterested. \n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- [VueVixens](http://VueVixens.org)\n\n- [yomamaisa.dev](https://yomamaisa.dev/#/)\n\n- [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469)\n\n- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)\n\n**Jen Looper:**\n\n- [jenlooper.com](https://www.jenlooper.com/)\n  \n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jenlooper?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n  \n- [Github](https://github.com/jlooper)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "There's a kind of \"black box\" mystery that surrounds illustrators and programmers, to someone who isn't one their skills seem like a form of magic, but to someone who is these skills are just the tools that they've been learning to use through time and hard work. \n\nMaggie is the course logo illustrator at egghead.io, and she has the challenge of turning the concepts being taught in the course into something more visually concrete. The challenge isn't necessarily the drawing, but the research that is needed to understand a topic to the point of being able to create an accurate metaphor that people who don't know what is being taught can grasp. Maggie discusses her process in research and creative thinking to get to that point.\n\nThe beginner's mindset is critical to Maggie for creating these illustrations. When someone becomes an expert in something, they tend to overlook things that have become muscle memory to them that make beginners struggle. You don't have to be an expert to teach something to someone! The problems that you ran into when learning a topic and the things that helped you wrap your head around it are still fresh in your mind and can be extremely valuable for other beginners and even those with experience. \n\nMaggie started a site called illustrated.dev to bring visual learning perspective of web development and internet concepts. There is a lot of content out there that teaches with language, but for many people, that style of learning makes it difficult for things to click. Never be afraid to teach things that are already being taught, often it is the way that you teach that matters most. \n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- [Schoolism](https://www.schoolism.com/)\n\n- [New Masters Academy](https://www.nma.art/)\n\n- [Illustrated.dev](https://illustrated.dev/)\n\n- [Design Synectics](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Synectics-Stimulating-Creativity/dp/0871921987)\n\n- [Art Synetics](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Synectics-Stimulating-Creativity/dp/0871921510/ref=pd_sim_14_1/147-9062490-5704104?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0871921510&pd_rd_r=5593d07f-6d37-11e9-9f57-c98fbdd56605&pd_rd_w=bz0Nf&pd_rd_wg=BdRmc&pf_rd_p=90485860-83e9-4fd9-b838-b28a9b7fda30&pf_rd_r=Y8M5NA27Z5PJKT9EE9F2&psc=1&refRID=Y8M5NA27Z5PJKT9EE9F2)\n\n- [Addiction by Design](https://www.amazon.com/Addiction-Design-Machine-Gambling-Vegas/dp/0691160880)\n\n\n**Maggie Appleton:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mappletons?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\n- [maggieappleton.com](http://maggieappleton.com/)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

It's easy to get overwhelmed with the constant influx of new technology, but it's also thrilling to learn the latest cool new thing! Stacey Mulcahy discusses how she embraces this deluge of technology by being a generalist, allowing her to make connections with more people than she would have if she specialized in one thing.\n\nStacy is a Maker, a kind of tech-based DIYer and inventor. Creativity is, of course, important for the DIY hacker, but it's essential for everyone else too. Creativity is creative problem solving, and it's something that you can train. If you aren't \"working your creativity muscle,\" your creative skills are going to degrade. Try to push the envelope and find outlets where you can apply your creative skills!\n\nLike a lot of people in the tech world, Joel has a box of Arduino stuff that is gathering dust somewhere. How do you get past that initial \"hello world\" LED blink project? Stacey recommends to immerse yourself, see what other makers are doing and find inspiration from them. Try to find something that you enjoy and find fun and see if you can do it with an Arduino. \n\nLastly, Stacey tells us her story of what caused her to begin teaching children technology, and how she got to where she is now. It's rewarding to celebrate people's successes and provide them with a space where they can fail safely. If there isn't a community meetup for something you enjoy in your area you have the complete ability to start one yourself and be the organizer. There are multiple platforms that help organize events. The key for your community to grow is to be consistent with it. \n\n---\n\n**Stacy Mulcahy:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bitchwhocodes)\n\n- [thebitchwhocodes.com](http://thebitchwhocodes.com)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

That doesn't mean that there isn't a time cost though, it isn't easy, but the internet has an overwhelming amount of information that you can use to teach yourself. Authors who write this free content are the life-blood of the internet and provide an invaluable service to countless people. \n\nHowever, in the sea of information, it's easy for your content never to get noticed. You wrote that blog-post that killer blog-post on medium, but no-one seemed to have seen it. Where you write your content is important, there are communities like the amazing dev.to that reach a specific audience and are more focused towards engagement, but the reason why you create your content is also important. People can smell inauthenticity if you are writing your content for the sole purpose of brand-building and getting views people are going to notice. Create content that you love and that you find interesting. You don't even have to be an absolute expert to teach, writing about what you are learning helps people learn right along with you!\n\nLearning a discipline you love profoundly is invaluable, but that doesn't mean you should turn a blind eye to other subjects. It's valuable to have a breadth of general knowledge across different disciplines and be able to have high-level conversations. \n\nA huge part of learning is asking people good questions. When you don't ask good questions, you are doing both yourself and the person you are asking a disservice. When you are too vague about what you are missing, and you don't give enough context, it's difficult to get a clear answer, and you are putting the burden of figuring that stuff out on the person you are asking. \n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- [Stack Overflow: How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)\n\n- [Chris Fritz: 7 Secret Patterns ](https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-us-2018/7-secret-patterns-vue-consultants-dont-want-you-to-know-chris-fritz)\n\n- [Jason Lengstorf: Cutting Work in Half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KREV1_2mA4)\n\n**Emma Wedekind:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emmawedekind?lang=en)\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/emmawedekind)\n\n- [Website](https://emmawedekind.com/)  \n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Marcy Sutton is the Head of Learning at GatsbyJS, but what does that mean? One of Gatsby's core focuses is the community, and a part of that is making the experience with Gatsby as friendly as possible. A large part of making Gatsby friendly is having *excellent* documentation, so that learning and debugging experiences would be smooth. \n\nSo the learning experience is smooth but what is Gatsby's potential on the web? Marcy talks about how Gatsby has the potential to make a huge impact. Currently, WordPress is powering about a third of the internet, that's huge, but it has its issues. WordPress is centered around the authoring experience, but the front-end experience is not good. Gatsby is looking more towards the future, it doesn't use a database, it can build out static HTML, it's accessible, and it's also democratizing the experience with a themes ecosystem. \n\nThis brings up the point that JavaScript is eating the web and it's making it more difficult for folks who've had a different intro to web development. This is a real challenge and people are having their careers impacted, what can we do to reconcile this? The decisions made by tech teams aren't considering this when they pick the technologies that they use, they're choosing tech that's going to deliver a high-performance application, where do HTML and CSS fit into this? Marcy discusses how we can bridge the gap and find ways to include people with different skill sets. \n\nMarcy also discusses the inclusive community that she has helped build, NW Tech Women, a small group out of Bellingham WA that hosts social events, but also volunteers and pairs with non-profits to make a community impact. \n\n--- \n\n**Links:**\n\n- [NW Tech Women Twitter](https://twitter.com/NWTechWomen)\n\n- [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/)\n\n- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)\n\n**Marcy Sutton:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcysutton)\n\n- [Website](https://marcysutton.com/)\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/marcysutton)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Sara Vieira, developer advocate and professional maker of dumb shit, talks through why she does her weird experiments on the internet. Sometimes it is out of need, but honestly a lot of the time it is a random thing that she thinks of or something that someone says that brings up the idea, and she just has to make it. A lot of it is out of boredom, and also procrastination from other projects that she just doesn't want to do. \n\nSara calls herself a lazy developer, but that doesn't mean she isn't working. She finds simpler solutions that involve less coding and also avoids things that aren't necessarily interesting or fun for her to do, like CSS or writing her talk for a conference... A part of being a lazy developer is using the right tool for the job. GraphQL and Redux have an almost cult-like following, but for small apps, their solutions for state management and fetching data are complete overkill.\n\nNetlify and Zeit's Now are great for deploying your projects, they allow you to get your unique dumb-shit out there quickly. There was this period where services were all focusing on scalability, but it wasn't easy to just throw your wacky side-projects out on the internet. \n\nSara is organizing the conference ReactJS Girls which will be happening in London on May 3rd, 2019. It started last year while Sara was living in London. She hosted a meetup where all the speakers would be women, but everyone was welcome to attend as a guest. Organizing it this way had multiple benefits, it acted as a filter for the dicks who wouldn't want to learn from women, and it empowered first-time speakers who'd otherwise feel imposter syndrome or fear of judgment. \n\n--- \n\n**Resources:** \n\n- [ReactJS Girls Conference](https://reactjsgirls.com)\n\n- [ReactJS Girls Twitter](https://twitter.com/reactjsgirls?lang=en)\n\n- [meme.iamsaravieira.com](https://meme.iamsaravieira.com/)\n\n- [dan.church](https://dan.church/)\n\n- [awesometalks.party](https://awesometalks.party/)\n\n**Sara Vieira:** \n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW)\n  \n- [Website](https://iamsaravieira.com/)\n  \n- [GitHub](https://github.com/SaraVieira)\n\n- [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikkitaftw)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Tania Rascia works as a web developer full time. However, just a few years ago she was working as a professional chef. How and why did she make such a dramatic career switch? It isn't uncommon for culinary professionals to realize that they don't want to spend the rest of their life doing it. It is a very demanding job and isn't sustainable if passion isn't there. \n\nSo, having always been interested in computers and making websites, Tania decided to make the transition into programming as a profession. Starting with one-off small odd jobs on Craigslist, then an internship, and then a full-time web developer! There were a lot of skills and concepts that had to be learned in those three years, especially starting from near zero. \n\nSharing what she learned publically played an essential role in Tania's development. It's like writing documentation for herself, but everyone who read her posts got to benefit from it too. Tania also places a lot of importance in creating your own version of something to fully understand it. For instance, she didn't understand how bootstrap worked, so she experimented and worked on creating her own dynamic CSS grid framework to achieve that more in-depth understanding. \n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- [Getting Started with React](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/)\n\n- [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/)\n\n- [A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript](https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Way-Learn-JavaScript-technology-ebook/dp/B00H1W9I6C)\n\n- [You Don't Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)\n\n\n**Tania Rascia:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/taniarascia)\n\n- [Website](https://www.taniarascia.com/)\n\n- [Github](https://github.com/taniarascia)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Today Angie Jones, a master inventor and automated testing engineer, speaks with us about what a master inventor is and what it took to receive that title, what testing automation is, having parallel between testers and developers, what developers can be doing to build more testable apps, and finally how modern web development has complicated automated testing.\n\nAngie talks about some common problems when it comes to testing. The test team is often separate from the developer team, and it leads to communication problems. Testers should be working in parallel with the dev team to ensure that from the get-go they are writing a testable app!\n\nAnother common problem is that 100% test coverage gets pushed. However, that's the wrong idea. Automated testing is expensive to implement, so Angie talks about how she figures out what'll give the most \"bang for your buck\" when deciding what tests get automated.\n\nApps aren't as simple as they used to be, and thicker client-side UIs have made it much harder to implement automated tests. Automated Engineer is a fully fledged development position requiring skill across platforms, which is why Angie says that developers shouldn't be leading automated testing. There is a lot that automated testers have to do and separate skills that they need to develop. There's only so much a person can keep up on at once.\n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Level up: playing the automation game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYrC3lLlwTM&t=0s&list=PLH36PGKycBeLQk4KAshSjYOSlOqHlvs9u&index=2)\n\n* [Bartle taxonomy of player types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types)\n\n* [Why Developers Should Not Lead Your Automation Efforts](http://angiejones.tech/why-developers-should-not-lead-your-automation-efforts/)\n\n* [Which Tests Should We Automate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL-_pnICmGY)\n\n**Angie Jones:**\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908)\n\n* [Github](https://github.com/angiejones)\n\n* [Website](http://angiejones.tech/)\n\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH36PGKycBeLQk4KAshSjYOSlOqHlvs9u)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

She joins us to talk about teaching specifics as opposed to high-level overviews, using zines to show that things that sound hard aren't hard in practice, the longevity of Julia's zine empire, and the impact that monetizing her zines had on her audience and the way she approaches working on them. \n\nJulia writes zines, short tutorials in comic form for software developers. She recently starting monetizing them, it had an impact on her audience but not as much as you would think. Monetizing even had the unforeseen side effect of her zines getting taken more seriously, a college professor even made then required reading in his class. \n\nShe tries to keep the zines focused, with the topics breaking down something very particular. High levels talks often have the problem of not imparting anything useful. The specificity respects people's time and also can give greater context than a high-level overview. It's also much easier to be motivated to start a twenty-page zine as opposed to a three-hundred-page book. \n\nJulia has many ideas for her zine empire. She wants to continue to collaborate with other developers so she can deliver content that isn't entirely in her wheelhouse. She also wants to start getting into some non-programming concepts, statistics in particular at some point. The possibilities with the medium are pretty much endless. \n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com/)\n\n**Julia Evans:**\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/b0rk)\n\n* [Github](https://github.com/jvns)\n\n* [Website](https://jvns.ca/)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Diana Rodriguez, Worldwide Community Organizer for the Vue Vixens Initiative, joins us today to talk about her early experiences with development as a child, her transition into a becoming a full-time professional and her work with getting women from communities all over the world involved with programming!\n\nIn the days of yore, gathering programming knowledge wasn't easy, the community was exclusive, and the books were expensive. The only ways to learn were through college, expensive books, or a cool friend willing to give you some information. Despite these difficulties Diana managed to be involved with the Java community, she also had the support of her parents who bought her books. Eventually, Diana's skills grew, and she would put herself out there taking programming gigs. However, it wasn't until six years ago that she decided to go full time.\n\nEventually, she became jaded with backend work and was craving something new, that's when she discovered Vue and its excellent and welcoming community. This community was much unlike the Java community back in the day, and Diana is working to be a part of that push for inclusivity full-force through Vue Vixens. Diana works to open and grow chapters all over the world.\n\nDiana talks about her recent work in South America and how the dev community was exploding, it was almost overwhelming! There were women from ages 13-72 at the meetup that the Vue Vixens organized in Argentina, the event even had to be split up over two days because there were so many people. Being careful of tunnel vision and thinking about these communities of people from foreign countries, women, and other underrepresented people in the tech and welcoming them can have a substantial positive impact.\n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- [Vue Vixens](https://vuevixens.org/)\n\n**Diana Rodriguez:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cotufa82)\n\n- [Website](https://beingadev.rocks)\n\n**John Lindquist:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

    "description": "Joel and Brian Lonsdorf discuss the pain and growth of learning, math as a source of truth, dispelling that idea that you need to be a wizard to enter the functional programming space, and finally how you can start including functional concepts in your day to day work.\n\nThere's a reason that mathematicians tend to be the best functional programmers. The theories and patterns directly apply, it has truth and purity. It's powerful, almost powerful enough to describe everything, so what makes people turn away from it?\n\nTraditionally, math gets taught in a dry manner from a young age, tables are memorized, and facts get drilled. It isn't until much later that interesting concepts like set theory get introduced, and at that point, it's too late for many people.\n\nMaterial that's \"dry\" doesn't have to be taught that way. It's been three and a half years since Brian first put Professor's Frisby's guide up on Github and it brought light and friendly perspective to heavy material. It showed that the functional programming paradigm was learnable without requiring a deep dive into Haskell.\n\nThe deep dive doesn't work for everyone. There's merit in starting with something like Gatsby and just getting something out there that you can play with immediately, and then later learn the fundamentals of Javascript. The same thing applies to learning functional programming. You can start composing with Lodash and ease into the deeper patterns and concepts.\n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide-old/content/)\n\n- [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript)\n\n- [Functional Composition with Lodash](https://hackernoon.com/function-composition-with-lodash-d30eb50153d1)\n\n- [State Monad in JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/state-monad-in-javascript)\n\n**Brian Lonsdorf:**\n\n- [Github](https://github.com/DrBoolean)\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drboolean?lang=en)\n\n- [Medium](https://medium.com/@drboolean)\n\n**Joel Hooks:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Today we are joined by Jem Young, a senior software engineer over at Netflix.\nJem is here to discuss his programming philosophy and how it is an extension of himself,\nhow engineers should have the freedom to have ideas and veto things, the difference passion makes, and being informed about the libraries that you include in your code and if they are actually needed.\n\nNetflix's homepage got 50% faster when Today Edwards had the idea of _not_ shipping\nReact to the client. All event handling was done with vanilla javascript and React remained on the server\nside. Finding this balance of developer productivity and performance is important. Jem talks about how you should really examine the reasons why you are including a library in your codebase, and to\nask yourself if it could be implemented in a simpler way with what you already have.\n\nJem discusses what it means to love the work you do and to have a real passion for creating\nsoftware. Passion makes a difference in a developer's career path, the devs who are just looking to make\na paycheck and don't really care don't end up in the same place that those who really care about their work do.\nJem is curious, he experiments with software on his weekends, he'll sometimes wake up at 1am with\nthe solution to a bug he's been thinking about all day, software is an integral part of his life beyond it just being how he puts food on the table.\n\nTopics:\n\n- Trusting your engineers to know what they are doing\n\n- Weighing the performance costs of included libraries\n\n- The difference that real passion for software makes\n\n- How programming is like solving a puzzle\n\n- How the code you write represents you\n\n---\n\n**Jem Young:**\n\n- [Github](https://github.com/young)\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jemyoung?lang=en)\n\n- [Website](https://jemyoung.com/about/)\n\n**John Lindquist:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

    "description": "Keith Peters joins us today to talk about his experiences with experimenting with code and math, the transition from Flash to Go, woodworking and blacksmithing, and getting books published.\n\nKeith talks to us a bit about multi trochoids; they're what happens when you take a circle and roll it around something,\nlike a spirograph. He was inspired to do this project by Sodaplay, a site back in the flash days that had stuff\nyou could hook up to various engines.\n\nWhat language did Keith use to write his multi trochoid experiments? Initially, Keith wrote it in Go, but he wanted to put it out on the web and make it interactive, so he ported it to Javascript.\n\nBack in the 90s Keith worked with Flash, when Flash left he moved over to Javascript and using the html5 canvas.\nJavascript is great if you want it live on the web but for still images and animations it was a pain in the neck, so Keith\ntried out Rust, Python, and finally settling on Go.\n\nKeith is into some non-coding hobbies like woodworking and knife making, Joel has even bought some of his knives.\nIt started when Keith wanted to build an arcade cabinet, he bought tools and got into learning how to use them.\nKeith has found a lot of crossover with working with his hands and building things with code, both of them can be boiled down to learning a technology to create things and solve problems.\n\nFinally, Keith explains the pros and cons of going through a publisher to get your book out. He says that self-publishing is easier than ever, but a publisher provides you with a lot of assistance with editing, marketing, artwork, and a healthy dose of pressure.\n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n- [Trochoid Experiments](https://bit101.github.io/lab/dailies/170117.html)\n\n- [playingwithchaos.net](http://www.playingwithchaos.net/)\n\n**Keith Peters:**\n\n- [Twitter][1]\n\n- [Github][2]\n\n- [Website][3]\n\n**John Lindquist:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://twitter.com/bit101\n  [2]: https://github.com/bit101\n  [3]: https://www.bit-101.com/blog/",

    "description": "Dave Smith is on the Alexa Team at Amazon, he hosts the Soft Skills Engineering podcast and headed up the recent Utah JS Conference.\n\nRecently Dave asked on Twitter \"on a scale of 1 - 10 in difficulty how would you\nrate the task of writing a function that iterates over a list of strings and returns the top 10?\"\nThis sparked up a lot of good, and most people rated it a 2-3 until people started asking \"wait, is this question in an interview context? In that case, it's a solid 10.\" \nDave talks about how the external stresses of an interview can turn even a \"simple\" question into a very stressful and challenging experience. \n\nThe topic of interview \"red flags\" comes up, and Dave explains how the biggest one is refusing to answer a question. \nHe says that even if you don't have an answer to something try to follow up with more questions and have humility, you are there to present yourself. Dave also says not to make up or guess at something if you don't know the answer, try to ask them to rephrase the question and give the angle of your own understanding. \n\nDave has his own excellent podcast with his co-host Jamison Dance called Soft Skills Engineering, check it out in the link below. \n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Soft Skills Engineering Podcast](https://softskills.audio/)\n\n* [Utah JS Conference](https://conf.utahjs.com/)\n\n**Dave Smith:**\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-smith-8895461/)\n\n- [Github](https://github.com/djsmith)\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/djsmith42)\n\n- [Medium](https://medium.com/@djsmith42)\n\n**John Lindquist:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

Eve says she believes it's because people realize that are a lot of clients that need data and they only need to load the smallest amount of data that's necessary. \n\nEveryone always says to have a project app to learn something new but what do you even build if you have \"no good ideas\"? Eve talks about what makes a good learning project. Keep the scope really small. Some variant of a to-do app is a great project. \n\nFinally, Eve talks about her work with the High Fives Foundation.

He was a musician.\nJason's band didn't have much money, so he learned design to make merch, learned some markup to edit their myspace, eventually learned to build a website for them, then learned backend so his bandmates could upload images and post things. \n\nJason talks about Gatsby's plans to compete with the more seamless WordPress model. He also talks about gatsby's differences from WordPress and the use cases for each service.\nOne of Gatsby's strengths is how good it is for learning Javascript and React, you can quickly go from the command line to getting stuff on the screen in two minutes, much like create-react-app, the differences is that with Gatsby you get a data layer and a good deployment story. \n\nFinally, they talk about what it's like to manage a repo that has 964 contributors, 5500 commits, and 936 issues. It was more chaotic in the early days, but they have brought on some people who are helping manage it and are defining better processes. \n\nIf you are interested in learning Gatsby, they have recently put much work into revamping their official tutorials. \n[Check them out here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)\n\n\n\n**Topics:**\n\n* His early musical aspirations that lead to his career as a developer\n\n* Gatsby's goals in creating an agnostic unified data layer.\n\n* The differences between Gatsby and other static site generators\n\n* Gatsby 2 and its many performance upgrades\n\n* Managing a large and active repository\n\n---\n\n**Links:**\n\n- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)\n\n- [Gatsby on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs)\n\n- [Gatsby Tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)\n\n- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n\n**Jason Lengstorf:**\n\n- [Website](https://lengstorf.com/)\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf)\n\n- [Github](https://github.com/jlengstorf)\n\n**John Lindquist:**\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

    "description": "Henry Zhu is currently a steward for Babel, and today he'll be discussing the management and lifestyle side of working on an open source project full-time.\n\nThe financial side to open source is interesting. Henry talks about where he gets his money and how he can be financially independent while still working on open source full time. Most of the money comes from donations through Open Collective and Patreon. A lot of the donations come from users, but corporations do donate as well. Henry also discusses the stability of it, and how the NPR model of asking for donations can lead to uncertainty about the next month. \n\nHenry says he's enjoying the management and marketing side of being a steward about as much as he enjoys coding. It's a side that people don't often think about with open source. This side of it includes a lot of marketing and interacting with the greater community, as well as the other maintainers and contributors to babel. \n\nHow does Henry handle all this responsibility when there is no one above him telling him when to take a break, or when to go on vacation? Henry and Joel talk about having a positive \"selfishness\", and taking care of yourself so that the project can prosper. If you want to be doing it for years you have to make sure that you don't burn out. \n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)\n* [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X)\n* [You Are What You Love](https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-What-Love-Spiritual/dp/158743380X)\n* [Tiny Habits](https://www.tinyhabits.com/)\n* [Kai Davis](https://kaidavis.com/articles/)\n\n### Henry Zhu\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/left_pad?lang=en)\n* [Website](https://www.henryzoo.com/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/hzoo)\n* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/henryzhu)\n* [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/babel#)\n\n### Joel Hooks:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

Phil will be talking about his work in design and programming, styled components, the process of making a font, and finally some advice to anyone who wants to make a font of their own.\n\nSo what are styled components? It's a new component-based CSS and Jest library. It's all about using these small styled components that you put in instead of HTML. It's nice because you don't have to create a whole new component that renders for some simple styling.\n\nPhil talks about as a developer he's always been in a role where he's had to work closely with designers and provide feedback for them. Over time he started to work more with design projects, and as he worked for small startups without a lead design, he found himself filling that role.\n\nDank Mono is Phil's first font, He's always enjoyed typography, and as he's gone along it starting turning out better than he thought. When he started, he just wanted to make some ligatures for Operator Mono, but there were some terms in there that would prevent him from ever being able to share it.\n\nIn the beginning, Phil was doing every letter from scratch. He started with an h because it has an excellent shape that can be reused with many letters. Halfway through he learned that Glyphs app supports components, so he had to start over after a week!\n\nPhil encourages anyone who is not entirely satisfied with the fonts available to think about what they'd want to change. He recommends to start with Glyphs app and watch and read its related talks and tutorials and to start with a single letter to see how you like it!\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n\n* [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/)\n* [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/)\n\n### Phil Pluckthun\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_philpl?lang=en)\n* [Github](https://github.com/kitten)\n* [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/@philpl)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

    "description": "We are joined by Ives Hoorne, a developer at Catawiki and creator of code sandbox. Today he talks about how he began writing code, how Minecraft modding made him love it, his interest in the company Catawiki and how he taught himself web development to work there, and finally the future for his projects.\n\nIves began coding at 11 years old. He was fascinated by secret languages, so he and his friend made a program in Visual Basic that would jumble text and another that would decipher the text. They would send these to each other as public facebook messages. It fell off after this project for awhile. After a few years, Ives got back into it when Minecraft came around, and he started writing mods for it.\n\nThe success and popularity of Code Sandbox made Ives happy. He enjoys how it became popular and how some of the bigger names such as Dan Abramov started talking about it. Though Ives discussions about how\nthis positive feedback caused him to attach his self-worth to the project, and how he had to let that go\nso he wouldn't be hurt by snarky feedback and other forms of negativity related to his project.\n\nThere were a couple of surprises in the development of Code Sandbox. Code Sandbox stores all files and directories in their Postgres database. When they fork Code Sandbox, they copy all the files, directories, and sandboxes over. Ives thought this wouldn't scale but somehow they now have 400k sandboxes, and the database is only four gigabytes! One of the negative surprises was when there was\nan error in the sandbox when someone tries to share their sandbox, the preview service would try over and over again to take a snapshot.\nThe following month their hosting bill was a dozen times the price as it usually was!\n\nIves' first experience speaking at a conference was much better than he expected. When he was presenting, he noticed that he was talking\nwith a bunch of people who were willing to listen to him. It was such a cool experience for him that he now loves speaking at conferences for him. Ives says he wants to start talking about things besides Code Sandbox,\nsuch as UI driven development for example. He says that it can be greatly improved, npm installing is still manually typing `npm install package-name`. He says that this can be made much better by being able to search for dependencies and directly add them with a single click.\n\nFinally, Ives talks about his plans for Code Sandbox. He plans on adding a dashboard because currently, it's very cumbersome to navigate to your sandbox. The dashboard will give you the ability to put sandboxes\nin directories organizing them that way. They are also managing offline support. Finally, they are adding team support so multiple people can all work on a sandbox at once.\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)\n* [catawiki](https://www.catawiki.com/)\n\n### Ives Van Hoorne\n* [Github](https://github.com/CompuIves)\n* [Website](https://ivesvh.com/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/compuives?lang=en&lang=en)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

    "description": "Today our guests and host talk about what pushed them to start living healthier lifestyles and what they are doing to maintain it. Leonard was 280 pounds when he was 23 at his heaviest, Taylor was 19 and 287 pounds, and John was 320 pounds.\n\nLeonard made a change due to having health issues with his heart, he got on P90x and after a year of it moved on to much better things, this got him to a muscular 190. John began because he failed a breathing test and only had 50% lung capacity, he got it into his head that he was a healthy person now and started using the elliptical and not eating junk food. Taylor was turning 20 as a milestone and decided to make a change by kicking soda, going vegetarian, riding his bike, and walking around more. His goal was never to get a six pack but just to live a healthier life.\n\nIt has been five years since Leonard's initial push to get fit. He says that the most significant thing has been finding a sustainable diet and exercise program that he can do for the rest of his life, well into his 80s. P90x is not sustainable, he followed it precisely for six months, but he was physically burning out and felt terrible.\n\nReading a book called the Primal Blueprint changed everything for Leonard. It teaches that manipulating your body composition is all about finding that balance of macronutrients and lifting heavy things while getting plenty of rest. Since he hated gyms and alpha attitudes, Leonard purchased a barbel, a squat cage, and some weights allowing him to take his body to the next level lifting heavy things three days a week. He blew through his weight stalls, cut down to sub 10% bodyfat, and developed significant musculature! Being a remote developer was the ideal environment for achieving these things due to the flexible schedule and ease of access to his home gym.\n\nFinally, things are wrapped up with Leonard explaining how having a healthy body and exercising have given him mental health benefits. The depression and anxiety he used to struggle with have been helped by the changes he has made. Taylor leaves us with the advice to do this for yourself, not for anyone else, and to take your time and not get into a big hurry with it. It takes time.\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [The Primal Blueprint](https://www.amazon.com/Primal-Blueprint-Reprogram-effortless-boundless/dp/0982207786)\n* [Leangains](https://leangains.com/the-leangains-guide/)\n* [The 7 Minute Workout](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/)\n* [The 4 Hour Body](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman-ebook/dp/B003EI2EH2)\n\n### Taylor Bell\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/taylorbell)\n  * [Github](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/)\n\n### Leonard Souza\n  * [Website](http://leonardsouza.com/)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jslauthor?lang=en)\n  * [Github](https://github.com/jslauthor)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

    "description": "We are joined by Brian Vaughn. Brian is on Facebook's Core React Team. He also contributes to a lot of open source products in the javascript space.\n\nWhile Brian went to college to study Graphic Design, he ended up transitioning into programming. During college, he did a lot of graphic design consulting work, as a way to pay his way through school. Eventually, he agreed to create a website for a client and found that programming was a much better fit.\n\nBrian built react-virtualized during his time he spent at Treasure Data. The company is really into open source, and many of his team members had projects out there. When they were writing the console, they used Facebook's fixed data table.\nHowever, it did not have the features that they wanted. So Brian volunteered and built what would be the first version of react-virtualized.\n\nThe exposure he got from sharing react-virtualized with the community is what landed him the job on the React Core Team. A developer's success tends to come from sharing the cool thing they built. Share your work everyone!\n\nBrian talks about React's goals with 17. Dan Abramov and Dominique have been working on creating an optimizing compiler for react components. The idea is that the compiler can read your components and optimize them. You will be able to keep writing React components in ways that make sense to you, and it will compile them and optimize at runtime. The team is also working on making functional components more powerful, so you do not have to reach out to class methods. It will be interesting to see what will shake out of their work when using async and the compiler.\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized)\n* [Prepack](https://prepack.io/)\n\n### Brian Vaughn\n* [Website](http://www.briandavidvaughn.com/#/home)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn?lang=en)\n* [Github](https://github.com/bvaughn)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

    "description": "John Lindquist asks Evan You when exactly did he become a developer? Evan talks about how the whole thing was a gradual process with no definite \"I'm a developer now!\" moment. Evan had a degree in art and art history, but he was finding it hard to find work. So Evan went back to school and enrolled in a design and technology program where everyone was forced to learn to code, this is where he first learned Javascript and found great enjoyment in using it.\n\nGoogle's Chrome experiments are what drove Evan to learn Javascript on a deeper level. Evan landed a job at Google Creative Labs after he created and put a portfolio of his prototypes out there once he thought himself to be good at programming. Google Creative Labs were looking for someone who could bring in design and build cool things quickly, they contacted Evan, and things sort of just fell together.\n\nGoogle Creative Labs was where Evan first started his work on Vue. As the project grew, the team started to use Angular 1. it had too many features that they didn't need. Evan also didn't like some of the design decisions that Angular 1 had. So, Evan started to work on a templating library just for his personal use. After six months, in February 2014, he officially released it as Vue.js, putting it out there for others for others to use. Initially, it was just a templating library but as the community grew and more features got requested Vue got built into the framework that it is today, being compared on the same level as React and Angular.\n\nFinally, Evan and John discuss Vue's future regarding single file components and proxies. Currently, there are still a lot of problems going with the compile on the fly approach. However, there is a spec being discussed called HTML Modules. Html Imports are getting dropped from the spec. There has been discussion around the HTML Modules spec that looks very similar to what single file components look like on the platform level.\n\nEvan plans to refactor Vue to leverage proxies. Currently, when Vue receives data, it will walk through all of its properties and convert them to getter/setters, this has caveats such as not tracking newly added properties when it finishes. Proxies allows them to get rid of these caveats. Proxy traps can track these changes!\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [Vue.js Website](https://vuejs.org/)\n* [HTML Import Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-imports/)\n* [All About Reactivity in Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html)\n* [Google Chrome Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome)\n* [Google Creative Labs Five Program](https://www.creativelab5.com/)\n\n### Evan You\n* [Github](https://github.com/yyx990803)\n* [Website](http://evanyou.me/)\n* [Blog](https://medium.com/@youyuxi)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanyou)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/youyuxi)\n* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

    "description": "Today Joel catches up with Iheanyi Ekechukwu. Iheanyi is a Product Engineer currently working at DigitalOcean. He previously worked at IBM on Watson. They also talk about Iheanyi's education, stack, and side projects\n\nIheanyi started out majoring in Computer Engineering, but switched to Computer Science after he figured out hardware just wasn't for him. He now lives and works in Brooklyn and spends most of his time coding (though he always brings his design skills to the table).\n\nIheanyi's design comes from a dual degree program at Notre Dame, the college where he graduated. He noticed a lot of subpar interfaces coming from pure programmers, and he was frustrated with that, so he took his school's opportunity to learn design and apply it to his work. Even if he isn't a designer, he uses his skills daily to communicate with designers and make whatever he works on that much better.\n\nIheanyi started using Ember back during college. He was frustrated by his school's class search interface, and he set out to improve it. Ember and Rails were like a match made in heaven for him, Ember having been authored by ex-Rails core team member, Yehuda Katz.\n\nJoel discusses with Iheanyi what he's currently using in his work. They get into GO, and how Iheanyi has enjoyed working with a statically typed language when doing back-end work. Not having to worry about full test coverage when refactoring has been great!\n\nLastly, they talk about the various side projects Iheanyi has going.\nSuch as Interface Lovers, a blog where top designers are interviewed and share their work music playlists. Also, Seeker, a job-board app that allows you to connect your strip account to it and have companies submit jobs.\n\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [seeker](https://seeker.company)\n* [Interface Lovers](https://interfacelovers.com/)\n* [Creative Black](http://creative.black/)\n* [Chef Watson](https://www.ibmchefwatson.com/)\n\n### Iheanyi Ekechukwu\n* [Website](https://iheanyi.com/)\n* [Podcast](http://www.twoblacknerds.com/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kwuchu)\n* [Github](https://github.com/iheanyi)\n* [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/iheanyi-ekechukwu)\n\n### Joel Hooks:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "Joel interviews Michel Weststrate, author of Mobx and his new library, Immer. Today they get into the power of Immer, its early success on Github, common mistakes in state management, and what is next for Mobx.\n\nImmer is a light-weight, immutable state-management tool. Michel talks with Joel about some of its capabilities. Immer takes an object and a function and can track all the changes made to that object, it then gives you back the original object and a mutated copy. Immer can replace reducers, Michel calls them \"producer\" functions as they \"produce\" the new state.\n\nJoel then asks Michel \"what makes state management so hard for people and are they overcomplicating it?\" This question leads to Michel explaining that people don't think enough about the structure of their state enough up front. When you talk about state, there are three distinct concepts, values, references, and identities. However, people tend to only think of state purely as data. \"You have to think about what is going to store it and what is going to reference it.\"\n\nMichel talks about how the mobx-state-tree fits into an application. Mobx is unopinionated; it doesn't tell you how to organize your stores. mobx-state-tree, however, is very explicit about the three concepts of state, values, references, and identities. With mobx-state-tree you organize your data into models and tell it how they relate to each other. It's all about consistently organizing your state!\n\nWhat's next for Mobx? Michel is currently working on some exciting features using proxies to make Mobx even more transparent than it is now. Michel has also been thinking about improving on asynchronous processes and how to leverage async actionables.\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [Immer](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer)\n* [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)\n* [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com/)\n\n### Michel Westrate\n* [Medium](https://medium.com/@mweststrate)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mweststrate?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n* [Github](https://github.com/mweststrate)\n* [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/michel-weststrate)\n\n### Joel Hooks:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

    "description": "John Lindquist speaks with Jack Doyle, the creator of Greensock. They discuss many things including the motivation behind the creation of Greensock, managing GSAP forums, and how he transitioned from Flash to Javascript.\n\nJack didn’t initially create Greensock to be a monetized business, but rather a helpful tool for other developers. He was working at an ad firm doing animation work, and it was there that he found the inspiration to create Greensock.\n\nThe [Robert Penner easing equations](http://robertpenner.com/easing/) were like magic for Jack. Such simple equations that could create such cool effects were terrific. He talks about how he doesn't consider himself a math wiz in the slightest. The visual feedback that animation gives with the equations however really help him solidify the concepts.\n\nJack's success turning his side project into a successful business is genuinely impressive.\nIt was a stressful time for him; he was working for the agency still at the time. People don't feel safe with a product that might lose support any day, so he goes into the security behind a financially backed product and the factors that lead to him monetizing his business.\n\nFinally, there is a lengthy discussion on the challenges of having to maintain such a universal library that works on nearly every platform. There are a **lot** of edge cases. Jack also makes an effort to keep the API stable, so that questions that you find online from ten years ago can still apply to you today.\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [Greensock](https://greensock.com/)\n* [Greensock Forums](https://greensock.com/forums/)\n* [Greensock Ease Visualizer](https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer)\n\n### Jack Doyle\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/greensock?lang=en&lang=en)\n* [Github](https://github.com/greensock)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

Today they discuss what got her from an art background to a full-time developer, resistance to change, why Vue is terrific, and the GreenSock animation platform (GSAP).\n\nSarah's background was very unusual for a developer. She graduated with a major in printmaking and became a scientific illustrator for a nature museum. She relates drawing to program in that it's just a series of formalized steps. Many people say they can't draw, but if they just opened up and learned the process they would become technically proficient in drawing!\n\nSarah also talks about how awesome GSAP is. Through benchmarking, she found that GSAP performed even better than native technologies when working with SVGs. She then gets into MorphSVG, and how it lets you transition between two SVGs and all sorts of things to create transitions.\n\nFinally, she discusses how she stays motivated on all the many projects she works on. She likes to imagine the feeling she'll get when she finally finishes it and lets that drive her. She also uses positive rewards for little milestones, such as eating a treat she enjoys or sitting in her favorite chair and relaxing.\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [egghead: Develop Basic Web Apps with Vue.js](https://egghead.io/courses/develop-basic-web-apps-with-vue-js)\n* [CSS Tricks: Intro to Vue](https://css-tricks.com/intro-to-vue-1-rendering-directives-events/)\n* [Greensock](https://greensock.com/)\n\n### Sarah Drasner\n* [Website](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)\n* [Github](https://github.com/sdras)\n* [egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/sarah-drasner)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

It's like a vast array of JSON objects that sync between two computers whenever they are both on the same network; this enables data to never reach an outside server, a true peer to peer network! Andre goes into his work on the project and why he believes it is necessary for the future of the web.\n\nBut what is the peer to peer web and why is it better/different than the internet as we know it? Andre says that we are reaching a point where innovation is beginning to stagnate, where it is just enough to have Google, Amazon, and Facebook. We have reached a sort of peak, and things aren't evolving further. Andre goes on to say that one of the fundamental things that the internet missed early on was that it didn't guarantee a p2p connection.\n\nAndre gives some examples of how you begin to use the p2p web today. The Beaker browser, for example, can still access HTTP and HTTPS connections. However, it can also use the DAT protocol. What is DAT? Well, it allows you to directly \"seed\" your website out, and others can \"leech\" it. Like torrents, the more peers there are accessing your website, the better! He also talks about Fritter, a twitter clone that only runs on DAT. You download the front-end and JSON files of what people are saying. You are even able to fork the front end and customize it for yourself!\n\nBack in Javascript land, Andre talks about how he plans to properly support the Pull data source in Cycle.js, as well as having web-workers in the middle. He also talks about why he's removing the last library dependency from Cycle.js, xstream, in favor of just using a set of callbag utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [Scuttlebutt on Github](https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebutt)\n* [Fritter on Github](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/libfritter)\n* [Callbag Spec on Github](https://github.com/callbag/callbag)\n* [The Beaker Browser](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker)\n* [Cycle.js](https://cycle.js.org/)\n\n### André  Staltz\n* [Website](https://staltz.com/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrestaltz)\n* [Egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/andre-staltz)\n* [Github](https://github.com/staltz)\n\t\t\n### Joel Hooks:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Website](https://joelhooks.com/)",

Ben discusses his career path, the benefits of having a mentor, and the importance of Data Driven Documents.\n\nBen talks about how he worked on a multi-year project for the Colorado Department of Education where he was visualizing aggregate standardized testing data. He discusses his experience there and how it left a long lasting enjoyment of the craft. He also talks about why he chose D3 for his data visualization work, and how he feels that it's the best option in the JS space.\n\nA lot of companies have D3 as a \"nice to have\" but not many devs have that skill. There is a lot of demand but not enough supply. Seeing this, Ben created a screencast for egghead as our very first instructor! His interest in info-products sparked and he talks about his experience and the challenges he faced building his email course and then a full-fledged D3 and SVG book.  \n\n---\n\n### Resources\n* [D3 in 5 Days](https://benclinkinbeard.com/d3in5days/)\n\n### Ben Clinkinbeard\n- [Egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/ben-clinkinbeard)\n- [Github](https://github.com/bclinkinbeard) \t\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bclinkinbeard?lang=en)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

They talk about the 12-factor style of building an application and why devs should have a standard method. \n\nOften developers don’t have a standard process with git. Mark talks about the gitflow workflow, a way of working with features and managing how that feature gets merged into the code base. \n\nThough due to working with so many branches gitflow has its complexities. So, Mark trimmed it down and created a new workflow he calls **git ship**, which is gitflow without the development and hotfix branches.\n\nBefore **Docker**, Mark was running through a dependency hell. Though with Docker Mark was just able to deploy an image and not have to worry about anything. Docker is like a VM but without all the memory overhead! You can even deploy as many images as you want at a time. You can run Postgres, Node servers, and also use entirely different languages in each image! \n\nCheck out Mark’s course which covers all mentioned topics, [Build a Twelve-Factor Node.js App with Docker](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-twelve-factor-node-js-app-with-docker)\n\n--- \n\n### Resources\n- [Gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n- [Mark’s 12-factor egghead Course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-twelve-factor-node-js-app-with-docker?utm_medium=podcast&utm_term=docker&utm_content=12-factor-node)\n\n### Mark Shust\n- [Github](https://github.com/markoshust)\n- [egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/mark-shust)\n- [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/markshust)\n- [Website](http://markshust.com/) \n\t\t\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

Rob talks about how the Angular team is working on really improving the code while still keeping the public API stable. He also talks about the team's ongoing debate on where to improve the code. Faster? Smaller? Currently, the team has chosen to work on making it smaller and has improved the bundle size of Angular. \n\nOne of the new things about Angular that people are most excited about is the Elements and CLI Schematics libraries. Juri talks about how Elements opens up a \"whole new world,\" allowing people not to have to resolve the same problems over and over again by letting them create reusable angular components. \n\nOne of the hardest things to learn with Angular was the design and architecture patterns. Rob goes into how the team has improved the documentation, now actually getting into best practices and giving architecture guidelines. \n\nFinally, our guests get into their favorite Angular libraries. NgRx Formly being the big favorite. NgRx Formly is a beautiful library that allows devs to create powerful reactive forms. \nRob also highly recommends the Angular Schematics library. It is a powerful low-level tool that allows you to create templates and code generators. You can even use it in conjunction with the Angular CLI to extend it or modify it for your own needs!\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n- [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)\n- [Angular Elements](https://github.com/robwormald/angular-elements) \n- [Angular Schematics](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-devkit/schematics)\n- [NgRx](https://github.com/ngrx/platform)\n- [Angular Reactive Forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms)\n\n### Rob Wormald\n-\t[Twitter](https://twitter.com/robwormald?lang=en)\n-\t[Github](https://github.com/robwormald)\n-\t[Egghead Courses](https://egghead.io/instructors/rob-wormald)\n\n### Juri Strumpflohner\n-\t[Twitter](https://twitter.com/juristr?lang=en)\n-\t[Blog](https://juristr.com/)\n-\t[Egghead Courses](https://egghead.io/instructors/juri-strumpflohner)",

No longer are you going in and writing HTML for all your pages, you are now writing powerful and useful javascript components. \n\nThe concepts that React got built upon don't just apply to React code. Joel talks about how he taught the React style of componentized code, but using Angular in the workshops he has run. \n\nKent and Joel also discuss the importance of ES6. There are still new Javascript tutorials that are get written in ES5, Joel explains why this is shortsighted. The future of Javascript is moving to ES6. Not only that but ES6 is an excellent improvement over ES5. \nNew and powerful features can be leveraged with it, spread syntax, arrow functions, modules.

They discuss the \"Redux phenomenon\" and the notion of improving the developer experience.\n\nDan's Redux course has been the most popular course on egghead.io for years. What caused Redux to blow up as it did? Dan is here today to talk about the problems he faced that inspired him to write this framework, and all the experiences he had that led to it.\n\nJoel and Dan talk about how quickly functional programming concepts pushed their way into the mainstream. When they were younger object oriented was how you programmed, Gang of Four was like their bible. \nHowever, Dan talks about the problems he was facing and how they inspired him to create Redux. \n\nDan's belief that user experience starts with the developer also inspired Redux. The notion that a developer should suffer is silly. Having a tool that is a joy to use and allows a programmer just to create things is invaluable. \n\nThe frustration of getting started with React was enormous. You had to deal with Webpack and install packages manually and hope that you didn't mess up. All this was hugely daunting for beginners especially. create-react-app was the solution for that. Allowing an easy way to get React going with a dev server and all, it let you just get in there and start building components. \n\nFinally, Joel and Dan leave us with a note to those seeking to learn to program well. Read GitHub like it's a blog. Read the commits, the issues, the PR's, all of it. You might not understand what is going on now, but you will build fluency and eventually you'll understand well enough that you can start to answer questions and contribute.\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n- [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)\n- [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)\n- [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)\n- [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)\n\n### Dan Abramov\n- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dan_abramov)\n- [Github](https://github.com/gaearon)\n- [Blog](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov)\n\n### Joel Hooks\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhooks)\n- [Github](https://github.com/joelhooks)\n- [Website](http://joelhooks.com/)",

Not only that but there are amazing tools that enable a beginner to just jump right in and _create_. \n\nPython is learnable to the point that even people outside of software development are using it as a tool to automate annoying manual tasks. Scripting away all the hard repetitive tasks at work until everyone thinks they are some kind of wizard. \n\nOne of the tools mentioned in the podcast is the wonderful [Cookiecutter Django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django). A great tool for beginners who don't want to deal with a million installs and an array of different skills just to get a project deployed. \n\nThe other tool mentioned, [The Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), gets python up and running right in your browser. Inline code and rich text documentation allow you to write code and see the results inline, even giving you the power to write documentation around the output.   \n\nCheck out Will's [new egghead course, Intro to Python](https://egghead.io/courses/intro-to-python), and jump into this rich, beginner-friendly world.\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)\n- [Cookie-cutter Django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) \n\n### Miller Hooks\n- [Github](https://github.com/millerhooks)\n\n### Will Button\n- [willbutton.co](https://willbutton.co/)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wfbutton)\n- [Github](https://github.com/rekibnikufesin)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",

Paul has released [a new course on egghead.io covering the topic of transducers](https://egghead.io/courses/quickly-transform-data-with-transducers) that is the spark for this conversation.\n\nTransducers are a a useful pattern that can deliver performance and readability, but are often misunderstood or obscure to many programmers. Along with transducers you'll learn more about monoids, folds, lenses and so much more.\n\n### Resources\n- [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript)\n- [Quickly Transforming Data with Transducers](https://egghead.io/courses/quickly-transform-data-with-transducers)\n- [flunc optics](https://github.com/flunc/optics) \n- [partial.lenses](https://github.com/calmm-js/partial.lenses) \n\n### Brian Lonsdorf\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drboolean?lang=en)\n- [Github](https://github.com/DrBoolean)\n- [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/brian-lonsdorf)\n\n### Paul Frend\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pfrendly?lang=en)\n- [Github](https://github.com/pfrend)\n- [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/paul-frend)\n\n### John Lindquist:\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnlindquist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n- [Website](https://johnlindquist.com/)",
