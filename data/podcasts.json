It isn't uncommon for culinary professionals to realize that they don't want to spend the rest of their life doing it. It is a very demanding job and isn't sustainable if passion isn't there.</p>\n\n<p>So, having always been interested in computers and making websites, Tania decided to make the transition into programming as a profession. Starting with one-off small odd jobs on Craigslist, then an internship, and then a full-time web developer! There were a lot of skills and concepts that had to be learned in those three years, especially starting from near zero.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing what she learned publically played an essential role in Tania's development. It's like writing documentation for herself, but everyone who read her posts got to benefit from it too. Tania also places a lot of importance in creating your own version of something to fully understand it. For instance, she didn't understand how bootstrap worked, so she experimented and worked on creating her own dynamic CSS grid framework to achieve that more in-depth understanding.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Tania Rascia:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/taniarascia\">Twitter</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.taniarascia.com/\">Website</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia\">Github</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/\">Getting Started with React</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://sivers.org/\">Derek Sivers</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Way-Learn-JavaScript-technology-ebook/dp/B00H1W9I6C\">A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS\">You Don't Know JavaScript</a></p></li>\n</ul>",

The test team is often separate from the developer team, and it leads to communication problems. Testers should be working in parallel with the dev team to ensure that from the get-go they are writing a testable app!</p>\n\n<p>Another common problem is that 100% test coverage gets pushed. However, that's the wrong idea. Automated testing is expensive to implement, so Angie talks about how she figures out what'll give the most \"bang for your buck\" when deciding what tests get automated.</p>\n\n<p>Apps aren't as simple as they used to be, and thicker client-side UIs have made it much harder to implement automated tests. Automated Engineer is a fully fledged development position requiring skill across platforms, which is why Angie says that developers shouldn't be leading automated testing. There is a lot that automated testers have to do and separate skills that they need to develop. There's only so much a person can keep up on at once.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Angie Jones:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/techgirl1908\">Twitter</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/angiejones\">Github</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://angiejones.tech/\">Website</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH36PGKycBeLQk4KAshSjYOSlOqHlvs9u\">YouTube</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYrC3lLlwTM&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLH36PGKycBeLQk4KAshSjYOSlOqHlvs9u&amp;index=2\">Level up: playing the automation game</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types\">Bartle taxonomy of player types</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://angiejones.tech/why-developers-should-not-lead-your-automation-efforts/\">Why Developers Should Not Lead Your Automation Efforts</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL-_pnICmGY\">Which Tests Should We Automate</a></p></li>\n</ul>",

She recently starting monetizing them, it had an impact on her audience but not as much as you would think. Monetizing even had the unforeseen side effect of her zines getting taken more seriously, a college professor even made then required reading in his class.</p>\n\n<p>She tries to keep the zines focused, with the topics breaking down something very particular. High levels talks often have the problem of not imparting anything useful. The specificity respects people's time and also can give greater context than a high-level overview. It's also much easier to be motivated to start a twenty-page zine as opposed to a three-hundred-page book.</p>\n\n<p>Julia has many ideas for her zine empire. She wants to continue to collaborate with other developers so she can deliver content that isn't entirely in her wheelhouse. She also wants to start getting into some non-programming concepts, statistics in particular at some point.

The only ways to learn were through college, expensive books, or a cool friend willing to give you some information. Despite these difficulties Diana managed to be involved with the Java community, she also had the support of her parents who bought her books. Eventually, Diana's skills grew, and she would put herself out there taking programming gigs. However, it wasn't until six years ago that she decided to go full time.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, she became jaded with backend work and was craving something new, that's when she discovered Vue and its excellent and welcoming community. This community was much unlike the Java community back in the day, and Diana is working to be a part of that push for inclusivity full-force through Vue Vixens. Diana works to open and grow chapters all over the world.</p>\n\n<p>Diana talks about her recent work in South America and how the dev community was exploding, it was almost overwhelming! There were women from ages 13-72 at the meetup that the Vue Vixens organized in Argentina, the event even had to be split up over two days because there were so many people.

The theories and patterns directly apply, it has truth and purity. It's powerful, almost powerful enough to describe everything, so what makes people turn away from it?</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, math gets taught in a dry manner from a young age, tables are memorized, and facts get drilled. It isn't until much later that interesting concepts like set theory get introduced, and at that point, it's too late for many people.</p>\n\n<p>Material that's \"dry\" doesn't have to be taught that way. It's been three and a half years since Brian first put Professor's Frisby's guide up on Github and it brought light and friendly perspective to heavy material. It showed that the functional programming paradigm was learnable without requiring a deep dive into Haskell.</p>\n\n<p>The deep dive doesn't work for everyone. There's merit in starting with something like Gatsby and just getting something out there that you can play with immediately, and then later learn the fundamentals of Javascript. The same thing applies to learning functional programming. You can start composing with Lodash and ease into the deeper patterns and concepts.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Brian Lonsdorf:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/DrBoolean\">Github</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/drboolean?lang=en\">Twitter</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@drboolean\">Medium</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide-old/content/\">Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript\">Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/function-composition-with-lodash-d30eb50153d1\">Functional Composition with Lodash</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/state-monad-in-javascript\">State Monad in JavaScript</a></p></li>\n</ul>",

All event handling was done with vanilla javascript and React remained on the server\nside. Finding this balance of developer productivity and performance is important. Jem talks about how you should really examine the reasons why you are including a library in your codebase, and to\nask yourself if it could be implemented in a simpler way with what you already have.</p>\n\n<p>Jem discusses what it means to love the work you do and to have a real passion for creating\nsoftware. Passion makes a difference in a developer's career path, the devs who are just looking to make\na paycheck and don't really care don't end up in the same place that those who really care about their work do.\nJem is curious, he experiments with software on his weekends, he'll sometimes wake up at 1am with\nthe solution to a bug he's been thinking about all day, software is an integral part of his life beyond it just being how he puts food on the table.</p>\n\n<p>Topics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Trusting your engineers to know what they are doing</p></li>\n<li><p>Weighing the performance costs of included libraries</p></li>\n<li><p>The difference that real passion for software makes</p></li>\n<li><p>How programming is like solving a puzzle</p></li>\n<li><p>How the code you write represents you</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Jem Young:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/young\">Github</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jemyoung?lang=en\">Twitter</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://jemyoung.com/about/\">Website</a></p></li>\n</ul>",

He was inspired to do this project by Sodaplay, a site back in the flash days that had stuff\nyou could hook up to various engines.</p>\n\n<p>What language did Keith use to write his multi trochoid experiments?

It's nice because you don't have to create a whole new component that renders for some simple styling.</p>\n\n<p>Phil talks about as a developer he's always been in a role where he's had to work closely with designers and provide feedback for them. Over time he started to work more with design projects, and as he worked for small startups without a lead design, he found himself filling that role.</p>\n\n<p>Dank Mono is Phil's first font, He's always enjoyed typography, and as he's gone along it starting turning out better than he thought. When he started, he just wanted to make some ligatures for Operator Mono, but there were some terms in there that would prevent him from ever being able to share it.</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning, Phil was doing every letter from scratch. He started with an h because it has an excellent shape that can be reused with many letters. Halfway through he learned that Glyphs app supports components, so he had to start over after a week!</p>\n\n<p>Phil encourages anyone who is not entirely satisfied with the fonts available to think about what they'd want to change. He recommends to start with Glyphs app and watch and read its related talks and tutorials and to start with a single letter to see how you like it!</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dank.sh/\">Dank Mono</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glyphsapp.com/\">Glyphs</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_philpl?lang=en\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kitten\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@philpl\">Medium Blog</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "<p>We are joined by Ives Hoorne, a developer at Catawiki and creator of code sandbox. Today he talks about how he began writing code, how Minecraft modding made him love it, his interest in the company Catawiki and how he taught himself web development to work there, and finally the future for his projects.</p>\n\n<p>Ives began coding at 11 years old. He was fascinated by secret languages, so he and his friend made a program in Visual Basic that would jumble text and another that would decipher the text. They would send these to each other as public facebook messages. It fell off after this project for awhile. After a few years, Ives got back into it when Minecraft came around, and he started writing mods for it.</p>\n\n<p>The success and popularity of Code Sandbox made Ives happy. He enjoys how it became popular and how some of the bigger names such as Dan Abramov started talking about it. Though Ives discussions about how\nthis positive feedback caused him to attach his self-worth to the project, and how he had to let that go\nso he wouldn't be hurt by snarky feedback and other forms of negativity related to his project.</p>\n\n<p>There were a couple of surprises in the development of Code Sandbox. Code Sandbox stores all files and directories in their Postgres database. When they fork Code Sandbox, they copy all the files, directories, and sandboxes over. Ives thought this wouldn't scale but somehow they now have 400k sandboxes, and the database is only four gigabytes! One of the negative surprises was when there was\nan error in the sandbox when someone tries to share their sandbox, the preview service would try over and over again to take a snapshot.\nThe following month their hosting bill was a dozen times the price as it usually was!</p>\n\n<p>Ives' first experience speaking at a conference was much better than he expected. When he was presenting, he noticed that he was talking\nwith a bunch of people who were willing to listen to him. It was such a cool experience for him that he now loves speaking at conferences for him. Ives says he wants to start talking about things besides Code Sandbox,\nsuch as UI driven development for example. He says that it can be greatly improved, npm installing is still manually typing <code>npm install package-name</code>. He says that this can be made much better by being able to search for dependencies and directly add them with a single click.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Ives talks about his plans for Code Sandbox. He plans on adding a dashboard because currently, it's very cumbersome to navigate to your sandbox. The dashboard will give you the ability to put sandboxes\nin directories organizing them that way. They are also managing offline support. Finally, they are adding team support so multiple people can all work on a sandbox at once.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/\">Code Sandbox</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.catawiki.com/\">catawiki</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/CompuIves\">Github</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://ivesvh.com/\">Website</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/compuives?lang=en&amp;lang=en\">Twitter</a></p></li>\n</ul>",

Leonard was 280 pounds when he was 23 at his heaviest, Taylor was 19 and 287 pounds, and John was 320 pounds.</p>\n\n<p>Leonard made a change due to having health issues with his heart, he got on P90x and after a year of it moved on to much better things, this got him to a muscular 190. John began because he failed a breathing test and only had 50% lung capacity, he got it into his head that he was a healthy person now and started using the elliptical and not eating junk food. Taylor was turning 20 as a milestone and decided to make a change by kicking soda, going vegetarian, riding his bike, and walking around more. His goal was never to get a six pack but just to live a healthier life.</p>\n\n<p>It has been five years since Leonard's initial push to get fit. He says that the most significant thing has been finding a sustainable diet and exercise program that he can do for the rest of his life, well into his 80s. P90x is not sustainable, he followed it precisely for six months, but he was physically burning out and felt terrible.</p>\n\n<p>Reading a book called the Primal Blueprint changed everything for Leonard. It teaches that manipulating your body composition is all about finding that balance of macronutrients and lifting heavy things while getting plenty of rest. Since he hated gyms and alpha attitudes, Leonard purchased a barbel, a squat cage, and some weights allowing him to take his body to the next level lifting heavy things three days a week. He blew through his weight stalls, cut down to sub 10% bodyfat, and developed significant musculature! Being a remote developer was the ideal environment for achieving these things due to the flexible schedule and ease of access to his home gym.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, things are wrapped up with Leonard explaining how having a healthy body and exercising have given him mental health benefits. The depression and anxiety he used to struggle with have been helped by the changes he has made. Taylor leaves us with the advice to do this for yourself, not for anyone else, and to take your time and not get into a big hurry with it. It takes time.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Primal-Blueprint-Reprogram-effortless-boundless/dp/0982207786\">The Primal Blueprint</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://leangains.com/the-leangains-guide/\">Leangains</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/\">The 7 Minute Workout</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman-ebook/dp/B003EI2EH2\">The 4 Hour Body</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Media:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Taylor Bell</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/taylorbell\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tayiorbeii/\">Github</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Leonard Souza</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://leonardsouza.com/\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jslauthor?lang=en\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jslauthor\">Github</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The company is really into open source, and many of his team members had projects out there. When they were writing the console, they used Facebook's fixed data table.\nHowever, it did not have the features that they wanted. So Brian volunteered and built what would be the first version of react-virtualized.</p>\n\n<p>The exposure he got from sharing react-virtualized with the community is what landed him the job on the React Core Team. A developer's success tends to come from sharing the cool thing they built. Share your work everyone!</p>\n\n<p>Brian talks about React's goals with 17. Dan Abramov and Dominique have been working on creating an optimizing compiler for react components. The idea is that the compiler can read your components and optimize them. You will be able to keep writing React components in ways that make sense to you, and it will compile them and optimize at runtime. The team is also working on making functional components more powerful, so you do not have to reach out to class methods. It will be interesting to see what will shake out of their work when using async and the compiler.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized\">react-virtualized</a>\n* <a href=\"https://prepack.io/\">Prepack</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Social Media</strong>\n* <a href=\"http://www.briandavidvaughn.com/#/home\">Website</a>\n* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn?lang=en\">Twitter</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/bvaughn\">Github</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>John Lindquist asks Evan You when exactly did he become a developer? Evan talks about how the whole thing was a gradual process with no definite \"I'm a developer now!\" moment. Evan had a degree in art and art history, but he was finding it hard to find work. So Evan went back to school and enrolled in a design and technology program where everyone was forced to learn to code, this is where he first learned Javascript and found great enjoyment in using it.</p>\n\n<p>Google's Chrome experiments are what drove Evan to learn Javascript on a deeper level. Evan landed a job at Google Creative Labs after he created and put a portfolio of his prototypes out there once he thought himself to be good at programming. Google Creative Labs were looking for someone who could bring in design and build cool things quickly, they contacted Evan, and things sort of just fell together.</p>\n\n<p>Google Creative Labs was where Evan first started his work on Vue. As the project grew, the team started to use Angular 1. it had too many features that they didn't need. Evan also didn't like some of the design decisions that Angular 1 had. So, Evan started to work on a templating library just for his personal use. After six months, in February 2014, he officially released it as Vue.js, putting it out there for others for others to use. Initially, it was just a templating library but as the community grew and more features got requested Vue got built into the framework that it is today, being compared on the same level as React and Angular.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Evan and John discuss Vue's future regarding single file components and proxies. Currently, there are still a lot of problems going with the compile on the fly approach. However, there is a spec being discussed called HTML Modules. Html Imports are getting dropped from the spec. There has been discussion around the HTML Modules spec that looks very similar to what single file components look like on the platform level.</p>\n\n<p>Evan plans to refactor Vue to leverage proxies. Currently, when Vue receives data, it will walk through all of its properties and convert them to getter/setters, this has caveats such as not tracking newly added properties when it finishes. Proxies allows them to get rid of these caveats.

    "description": "<p>Today Joel catches up with Iheanyi Ekechukwu. Iheanyi is a Product Engineer currently working at DigitalOcean. He previously worked at IBM on Watson. They also talk about Iheanyi's education, stack, and side projects</p>\n\n<p>Iheanyi started out majoring in Computer Engineering, but switched to Computer Science after he figured out hardware just wasn't for him. He now lives and works in Brooklyn and spends most of his time coding (though he always brings his design skills to the table).</p>\n\n<p>Iheanyi's design comes from a dual degree program at Notre Dame, the college where he graduated. He noticed a lot of subpar interfaces coming from pure programmers, and he was frustrated with that, so he took his school's opportunity to learn design and apply it to his work. Even if he isn't a designer, he uses his skills daily to communicate with designers and make whatever he works on that much better.</p>\n\n<p>Iheanyi started using Ember back during college. He was frustrated by his school's class search interface, and he set out to improve it. Ember and Rails were like a match made in heaven for him, Ember having been authored by ex-Rails core team member, Yehuda Katz.</p>\n\n<p>Joel discusses with Iheanyi what he's currently using in his work. They get into GO, and how Iheanyi has enjoyed working with a statically typed language when doing back-end work. Not having to worry about full test coverage when refactoring has been great!</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, they talk about the various side projects Iheanyi has going.\nSuch as Interface Lovers, a blog where top designers are interviewed and share their work music playlists. Also, Seeker, a job-board app that allows you to connect your strip account to it and have companies submit jobs.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Links:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://seeker.company\">seeker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://interfacelovers.com/\">Interface Lovers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://creative.black/\">Creative Black</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ibmchefwatson.com/\">Chef Watson</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Social Media:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://iheanyi.com/\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.twoblacknerds.com/\">Podcast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kwuchu\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iheanyi\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/instructors/iheanyi-ekechukwu\">egghead.io</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "<p>Joel interviews Michel Weststrate, author of Mobx and his new library, Immer. Today they get into the power of Immer, its early success on Github, common mistakes in state management, and what is next for Mobx.</p>\n\n<p>Immer is a light-weight, immutable state-management tool. Michel talks with Joel about some of its capabilities. Immer takes an object and a function and can track all the changes made to that object, it then gives you back the original object and a mutated copy. Immer can replace reducers, Michel calls them \"producer\" functions as they \"produce\" the new state.</p>\n\n<p>Joel then asks Michel \"what makes state management so hard for people and are they overcomplicating it?\" This question leads to Michel explaining that people don't think enough about the structure of their state enough up front. When you talk about state, there are three distinct concepts, values, references, and identities. However, people tend to only think of state purely as data. \"You have to think about what is going to store it and what is going to reference it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Michel talks about how the mobx-state-tree fits into an application. Mobx is unopinionated; it doesn't tell you how to organize your stores. mobx-state-tree, however, is very explicit about the three concepts of state, values, references, and identities. With mobx-state-tree you organize your data into models and tell it how they relate to each other. It's all about consistently organizing your state!</p>\n\n<p>What's next for Mobx? Michel is currently working on some exciting features using proxies to make Mobx even more transparent than it is now. Michel has also been thinking about improving on asynchronous processes and how to leverage async actionables.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Links:\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/mweststrate/immer\">Immer</a>\n* <a href=\"https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html\">Mobx</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.mendix.com/\">Mendix</a></p>\n\n<p>Social Media:\n* <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mweststrate\">Medium</a>\n* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mweststrate?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/mweststrate\">Github</a>\n* <a href=\"https://egghead.io/instructors/michel-weststrate\">egghead.io</a></p>",

They discuss many things including the motivation behind the creation of Greensock, managing GSAP forums, and how he transitioned from Flash to Javascript.</p>\n\n<p>Jack didn’t initially create Greensock to be a monetized business, but rather a helpful tool for other developers. He was working at an ad firm doing animation work, and it was there that he found the inspiration to create Greensock.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://robertpenner.com/easing/\">Robert Penner easing equations</a> were like magic for Jack. Such simple equations that could create such cool effects were terrific. He talks about how he doesn't consider himself a math wiz in the slightest. The visual feedback that animation gives with the equations however really help him solidify the concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Jack's success turning his side project into a successful business is genuinely impressive.\nIt was a stressful time for him; he was working for the agency still at the time. People don't feel safe with a product that might lose support any day, so he goes into the security behind a financially backed product and the factors that lead to him monetizing his business.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is a lengthy discussion on the challenges of having to maintain such a universal library that works on nearly every platform. There are a <strong>lot</strong> of edge cases. Jack also makes an effort to keep the API stable, so that questions that you find online from ten years ago can still apply to you today.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Resources:\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/\">Greensock</a>\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/forums/\">Greensock Forums</a>\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer\">Greensock Ease Visualizer</a></p>\n\n<p>Social Media:\n* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greensock?lang=en&amp;lang=en\">Twitter</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/greensock\">Github</a></p>",

She graduated with a major in printmaking and became a scientific illustrator for a nature museum. She relates drawing to program in that it's just a series of formalized steps. Many people say they can't draw, but if they just opened up and learned the process they would become technically proficient in drawing!</p>\n\n<p>Sarah also talks about how awesome GSAP is. Through benchmarking, she found that GSAP performed even better than native technologies when working with SVGs. She then gets into MorphSVG, and how it lets you transition between two SVGs and all sorts of things to create transitions.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, she discusses how she stays motivated on all the many projects she works on. She likes to imagine the feeling she'll get when she finally finishes it and lets that drive her. She also uses positive rewards for little milestones, such as eating a treat she enjoys or sitting in her favorite chair and relaxing.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong>\n* <a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/develop-basic-web-apps-with-vue-js\">egghead: Develop Basic Web Apps with Vue.js</a>\n* <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/intro-to-vue-1-rendering-directives-events/\">CSS Tricks: Intro to Vue</a>\n* <a href=\"https://greensock.com/\">Greensock</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Social Media:</strong>\n* <a href=\"https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/\">Website</a>\n* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Twitter</a>\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/sdras\">Github</a>\n* <a href=\"https://egghead.io/instructors/sarah-drasner\">egghead</a></p>",

It's like a vast array of JSON objects that sync between two computers whenever they are both on the same network; this enables data to never reach an outside server, a true peer to peer network! Andre goes into his work on the project and why he believes it is necessary for the future of the web.</p>\n\n<p>But what is the peer to peer web and why is it better/different than the internet as we know it? Andre says that we are reaching a point where innovation is beginning to stagnate, where it is just enough to have Google, Amazon, and Facebook. We have reached a sort of peak, and things aren't evolving further. Andre goes on to say that one of the fundamental things that the internet missed early on was that it didn't guarantee a p2p connection.</p>\n\n<p>Andre gives some examples of how you begin to use the p2p web today. The Beaker browser, for example, can still access HTTP and HTTPS connections. However, it can also use the DAT protocol. What is DAT? Well, it allows you to directly \"seed\" your website out, and others can \"leech\" it. Like torrents, the more peers there are accessing your website, the better! He also talks about Fritter, a twitter clone that only runs on DAT. You download the front-end and JSON files of what people are saying. You are even able to fork the front end and customize it for yourself!</p>\n\n<p>Back in Javascript land, Andre talks about how he plans to properly support the Pull data source in Cycle.js, as well as having web-workers in the middle. He also talks about why he's removing the last library dependency from Cycle.js, xstream, in favor of just using a set of callbag utilities.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Links:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebutt\">Scuttlebutt on Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/beakerbrowser/libfritter\">Fritter on Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/callbag/callbag\">Callbag Spec on Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker\">The Beaker Browser</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cycle.js.org/\">Cycle.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Social Media:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Andre Staltz:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://staltz.com/\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrestaltz\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/instructors/andre-staltz\">Egghead</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/staltz\">Github</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

They talk about the 12-factor style of building an application and why devs should have a standard method.</p>\n\n<p>Often developers don’t have a standard process with git. Mark talks about the gitflow workflow, a way of working with features and managing how that feature gets merged into the code base.</p>\n\n<p>Though due to working with so many branches gitflow has its complexities. So, Mark trimmed it down and created a new workflow he calls <strong>git ship</strong>, which is gitflow without the development and hotfix branches.</p>\n\n<p>Before <strong>Docker</strong>, Mark was running through a dependency hell. Though with Docker Mark was just able to deploy an image and not have to worry about anything. Docker is like a VM but without all the memory overhead! You can even deploy as many images as you want at a time. You can run Postgres, Node servers, and also use entirely different languages in each image!</p>\n\n<p>Check out Mark’s course which covers all mentioned topics, <a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-twelve-factor-node-js-app-with-docker\">Build a Twelve-Factor Node.js App with Docker</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<a name=\"Speaker\"></a>\n<h4>Speaker</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mark Shust\n\n<ul>\n<li>[Github] (<a href=\"https://github.com/markoshust\">https://github.com/markoshust</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/instructors/mark-shust\">egghead</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markshust\">Twitter </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://markshust.com/\">Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<a name=\"Resources.Mentioned\"></a>\n<h4>Resources Mentioned</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nvie/gitflow\">Gitflow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-twelve-factor-node-js-app-with-docker?utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_term=docker&amp;utm_content=12-factor-node\">Mark’s 12-factor egghead Course</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>",

Rob talks about how the Angular team is working on really improving the code while still keeping the public API stable. He also talks about the team's ongoing debate on where to improve the code. Faster? Smaller? Currently, the team has chosen to work on making it smaller and has improved the bundle size of Angular.</p>\n\n<p>One of the new things about Angular that people are most excited about is the Elements and CLI Schematics libraries. Juri talks about how Elements opens up a \"whole new world,\" allowing people not to have to resolve the same problems over and over again by letting them create reusable angular components.</p>\n\n<p>One of the hardest things to learn with Angular was the design and architecture patterns. Rob goes into how the team has improved the documentation, now actually getting into best practices and giving architecture guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, our guests get into their favorite Angular libraries. NgRx Formly being the big favorite. NgRx Formly is a beautiful library that allows devs to create powerful reactive forms.\nRob also highly recommends the Angular Schematics library. It is a powerful low-level tool that allows you to create templates and code generators. You can even use it in conjunction with the Angular CLI to extend it or modify it for your own needs!</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular 2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/robwormald/angular-elements\">Angular Elements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-devkit/schematics\">Angular Schematics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ngrx/platform\">NgRx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms\">Angular Reactive Forms</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Media:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Rob Wormald</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robwormald?lang=en\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/robwormald\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/instructors/rob-wormald\">Egghead Courses</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Juri Strumpflohner</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/juristr?lang=en\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://juristr.com/\">Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/instructors/juri-strumpflohner\">Egghead Courses</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

No longer are you going in and writing HTML for all your pages, you are now writing powerful and useful javascript components.</p>\n\n<p>The concepts that React got built upon don't just apply to React code. Joel talks about how he taught the React style of componentized code, but using Angular in the workshops he has run.</p>\n\n<p>Kent and Joel also discuss the importance of ES6. There are still new Javascript tutorials that are get written in ES5, Joel explains why this is shortsighted. The future of Javascript is moving to ES6. Not only that but ES6 is an excellent improvement over ES5.\nNew and powerful features can be leveraged with it, spread syntax, arrow functions, modules. These features are the direction Javascript is moving.</p>\n\n<p>So check it out.

    "description": "<p>Joel Hooks co-founder of egghead.io, interviews Dan Abramov, co-author of Redux. They discuss the \"Redux phenomenon\" and the notion of improving the developer experience.</p>\n\n<p>Dan's Redux course has been the most popular course on egghead.io for years. What caused Redux to blow up as it did? Dan is here today to talk about the problems he faced that inspired him to write this framework, and all the experiences he had that led to it.</p>\n\n<p>Joel and Dan talk about how quickly functional programming concepts pushed their way into the mainstream. When they were younger object oriented was how you programmed, Gang of Four was like their bible.\nHowever, Dan talks about the problems he was facing and how they inspired him to create Redux.</p>\n\n<p>Dan's belief that user experience starts with the developer also inspired Redux. The notion that a developer should suffer is silly. Having a tool that is a joy to use and allows a programmer just to create things is invaluable.</p>\n\n<p>The frustration of getting started with React was enormous. You had to deal with Webpack and install packages manually and hope that you didn't mess up. All this was hugely daunting for beginners especially. create-react-app was the solution for that. Allowing an easy way to get React going with a dev server and all, it let you just get in there and start building components.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Joel and Dan leave us with a note to those seeking to learn to program well. Read GitHub like it's a blog. Read the commits, the issues, the PR's, all of it. You might not understand what is going on now, but you will build fluency and eventually you'll understand well enough that you can start to answer questions and contribute.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<a name=\"Mentioned.Resources\"></a>\n<h3>Mentioned Resources</h3>\n\n<a name=\"Books\"></a>\n<h4>Books</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns\">Gang of Four</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/\">Game Programming Patterns</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<a name=\"Social.Media\"></a>\n<h4>Social Media</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dan Abramov\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gaearon\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@dan_abramov\">Blog</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Joel Hooks\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhooks\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joelhooks\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://joelhooks.com/\">Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<a name=\"Dan.s.Courses\"></a>\n<h4>Dan's Courses</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux\">Getting Started with Redux</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux\">Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux</a></li>\n</ul>",
