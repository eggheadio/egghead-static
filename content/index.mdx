## Recordings from our recent live events

- Tomasz ≈Åakomy's testing-centric talk [Sleeping Better at Night](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-egghead-talks-sleeping-better-at-night) was the first in our egghead talks series. There are some great observations and jumping off points to further (or even start) your testing routine.

- Sean Grove & John Lindquist streaming about [Convert a Reason App to JavaScript](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-convert-an-app-built-with-reason-reasonreact-into-javascript-react)

- Nick DeJesus, Ian Jones, Kevin Cunningham on a casual stream about [implementing testing in a library that uses React Hooks](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-nick-dejesus-testing-react-hooks-livestream-part-1). This was initially going to be a refactoring-centric stream, but there ended up being a lot to learn about testing.

These streams provide a lot of opportunity to see how other developers approach problem solving. We don't have any other impromptu events scheduled (by definition) but can tell you about the next event in the egghead talks series.

We also have Yonatan Kra adding to his [Critical Rendering Path](https://egghead.io/playlists/critical-rendering-path-c2ec) collection that has been giving me insight into the "how" behind JS in the browser and "why" things get bogged down.
